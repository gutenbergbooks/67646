<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FAMILIAR SONG.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>From a cottage window, embowered in azure morning
glories, a girl’s sweet voice sang blithely:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“My heart with joy would thrill if you loved me,
</div><div class="indent0">’Twould give this life of mine its fill of ecstasy;
</div><div class="indent0">Each golden moment spent with you on wings of Joy would flee;
</div><div class="indent0">The sky would be a ceaseless blue if you loved me!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Berry Vining, the little village beauty, singing so
blithely at her window of a love that as yet she had
never known, was at the crisis of her fate, for at that
very moment down the village street swept a gay
cavalcade of riders, and as the sweet voice floated out
upon the air, their glances turned upward in irrepressible
admiration.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“What odds to me how dark the night if you loved me,
</div><div class="indent0">For in your eyes a beacon light of love I’d see;
</div><div class="indent0">My future, now a dark abyss, forever changed would be,
</div><div class="indent0">To sunny paths of rosy bliss if you loved me!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>She was so lovely, this little Berry Vining, with her
wealth of curly chestnut locks, framing a face so fresh<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
and fair as the morning glories round the window&mdash;so
lovely, with her big, wondering, brown eyes under
long, shady lashes, her sea-shell tints, her perfect little
nose, and rose-red lips, and dainty chin, where dimples
swarmed, entrancingly, whenever she smiled, that no
one could look at her without admiration.</p>

<p>When all those eager eyes were leveled at her window
the girl drew very hastily backward, but not until
she had seen one hat lifted from a handsome head in
her honor, as the man’s eyes paid eager tribute to
her charms.</p>

<p>It all passed in a moment, but not too quickly for
that flashing glance to strike fire in a romantic maiden’s
heart.</p>

<p>The laughing, chattering riders passed on, the handsome
men, the pretty women, and Berry hid her blushing
face among the green, heart-shaped leaves of the
morning glories, and whispered to the flowers:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a handsome young man! What beautiful
eyes, what a loving smile! How grandly he
rode on that fine bay horse&mdash;like a young prince, I
fancy, although I never saw one&mdash;and how courteous
to bow to me, though he had never seen me before!
Even proud Miss Montague, who rode by his side, did
not appear to notice me, little Berry Vining, that she
has known all her life! Oh, how I envy her the joy<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
of being with him, of hearing him speak, and looking
into his beaming eyes! I would give the whole world
for such a splendid lover!”</p>

<p>“Berry! Berry!” called an impatient voice from the
foot of the stairs, but unheeding the summons, her
thoughts ran on in melodious whispers to the soft,
green leaves:</p>

<p>“Oh, I love him already, I cannot help it, for when
his eyes met mine a great rapturous shudder thrilled
me through my whole being and told me I had met
my fate! Oh, shall we ever meet again, I wonder!
We must, we must, or my heart will break with love
and longing! It was prophetic, that song I was singing
as his eyes met mine!” and she began to hum again
tenderly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“What odds to me how dark the night if you loved me,
</div><div class="indent0">For in your eyes a beacon light of love I’d see!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>“Berry!&mdash;Ber-en-i-ce Vi-ning!” called the impatient
voice downstairs again, and starting from her rosy
dreams of love, the girl flew to reply:</p>

<p>“Well, mamma?”</p>

<p>The pale, faded little mother answered complainingly:</p>

<p>“Always too late! I called you to look at the riding
party from Montague’s&mdash;their summer guests&mdash;five<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
grand couples of them, on horseback! But you
missed everything coming down so slow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, dear mamma, for I was watching them
from my window, and saw all. How fine they looked,
indeed! I wish I could be like them!”</p>

<p>“If wishes were horses beggars would ride!”
mocked the pale, tired mother sourly. “Come, now,
and tidy up the kitchen, for I must be off to my day’s
work. There’s no rest for the weary.”</p>

<p>She snatched down a rusty black bonnet from the
nail where it hung, and hurried from the house, hastening
downtown to the shop, where she worked by
the day for the pittance that supported herself and
daughter. She was a tailoress by trade, and had been
reared, wedded, and widowed in this little New Jersey
town. Her eldest children had all married, and gone
to humble homes of their own; she lived alone in the
tiny cottage with her youngest girl, Berenice, or Berry,
as she was familiarly called. A boy, still younger,
lived on a farm with a relative.</p>

<p>Berry, now almost nineteen, had many admirers, but
none of them had ever touched her romantic young
heart, much to the regret of her work-worn mother,
who longed to see her pretty darling settled down to
married life in a comfortable home, with a good husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>But Berry had only laughed at her suitors, for in
her girlish thoughtlessness she did not realize her
mother’s cares and anxieties. Unconsciously to herself,
perhaps, she had secret ambitions, born, it may
be, of her high sounding name Berenice, or the knowledge
that she had the gift of beauty, so potent in its
spell upon mankind.</p>

<p>Berry longed for higher things, and despised the
humdrum lives of her sisters with the humble mates
they had chosen. Like another Maud Muller, she
longed for something better than she had known.</p>

<p>So as she tucked the blue gingham apron over her
spotless print gown, and deftly tidied up the kitchen,
her excited thoughts followed the gay cavalcade of
riders with eager interest and longing.</p>

<p>“I believe I am as pretty as any of those proud,
rich girls,” she murmured, glancing into the little
cracked mirror over the mantel, and sighing: “Why
should I have so different a fate? Why did my poor
father have to drive an humble delivery wagon all his
life and die of a malarial fever at last; and why does
poor mamma have to work as a tailoress, while
Rosalind Montague has a millionaire for a father,
and a fine lady mother flaunting in silks and diamonds?
In only one thing has God made us equal, and that is
beauty. I have rivaled her to-day with her splendid<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
lover, and who knows but it may end in raising me
to her height of wealth and pride! If he loves and
marries me, how much I can do for poor mamma and
the others! They should never have to work so hard
again. Oh, I am so happy, hoping he loves me, for
even if he were poor and humble as I am, I could love
him just as well.”</p>

<p>“Rat-a-tat, rat-a-tat!” went the knocker on the door,
and her heart leaped wildly as she flew to open it.</p>

<p>There stood the red-headed lad from the florist’s
with a large bunch of splendid red roses, wet with
morning dew, and exhaling the rarest spicy fragrance.</p>

<p>“American beauties, Berry Vining&mdash;for you!” he
cried, thrusting them into her eager little hands, with
a significant grin on his good-natured, freckled face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE ROSY EMBLEM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Berry cried out in delight as she pressed the flowers
to her face:</p>

<p>“Oh, how sweet, how lovely! Who sent me the
roses, Jimmy Dolan?”</p>

<p>“Gent from up ter de hall, sure, but I dunno his
name. He was goin’ past our shop on horseback with
Miss Montague, and when they turned the corner he
rid back and bought these roses and guv me a dollar
ter bring ’em ter you, Berry&mdash;leastwise he said, ‘that
pretty girl in the morning-glory cottage down the
street,’ so I knowed ’twas you, and then he said: ‘Tell
her the roses came from an ardent admirer.’”</p>

<p>With that Jimmy darted away, and left Berry standing
with the roses pressed to her face, lost in a dream
of delight.</p>

<p>“He loves me, loves me! For love is the emblem
of the sweet, red rose,” thought the romantic little
maiden, trembling with pure joy.</p>

<p>To her young mind the gift of the roses was like an
avowal of love from the handsome stranger, and she
went happily about her simple tasks, hoping, praying
that before another day they might meet again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Vining came home that night to the
simple tea Berry had prepared, she wondered a little
that the girl wore the pretty, ruffled, white gown that
had been kept sacred to Sunday toilets before.</p>

<p>“Must be invited to a party&mdash;never saw your Sunday
gown on before, in the middle of the week,” she observed
tentatively.</p>

<p>Berry, blushing almost as red as the rose on her
breast, answered carelessly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I just thought of standing at the gate to see
the people going up to the lawn fête at the hall to-night,
you know.”</p>

<p>“And wishing in your heart you could go, too, silly
child; ain’t you, now? Well, you’re pretty enough to
be there, if that was all, Berry, but it isn’t, more’s the
pity for you, so don’t waste any regret on it, dearie, for
remember the true saying: ‘Poor folks have to have
poor ways.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it should be the way, mamma, for
I’ve often heard it said that clothes don’t make the
man&mdash;nor woman, either! For instance, now, Miss
Rosalind Montague is no better, nor prettier, than I
am, if she were stripped of her fine clothes and jewels!”</p>

<p>“Fie, fie! you vain little chick, I’m surprised at
your talk. Let me hear no more of it. You must be
contented in the sphere where Heaven has placed you,<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
Berry. Or, if you wish to better your lot, you have a
fine chance before you now.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” gasped Berry breathlessly.</p>

<p>“You have another proposal of marriage&mdash;one from
a rich man!”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma!” gasped Berry joyously, her eyes
beaming, her cheeks aflame.</p>

<p>She could think of one&mdash;only one lover&mdash;at this
moment.</p>

<p>How quickly he had found out her mother, how impetuous
he was, her handsome lover&mdash;how impetuous,
how adorable!</p>

<p>The future stretched before her eyes in a haze of
bliss&mdash;the realization of all the golden gleams she had
been weaving to-day on the airy foundation of a bow
and smile, and the gift of a bunch of red roses!</p>

<p>Silly, happy little Berry! How quickly her dream
was to be shattered!</p>

<p>Mrs. Vining, draining her teacup, and setting it
back in its saucer, now continued blandly:</p>

<p>“To-day my employer&mdash;Widower Wilson, you know&mdash;was
talking to me about this very lawn fête that
the Montagues are giving up at the hall to-night, and
he said it was to announce Miss Rosalind’s betrothal
to Senator Bonair’s handsome son, the one that rode<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
with her this morning, Berry. And he went on to
say&mdash;what do you think, my dear?” triumphantly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” Berry answered, with a
sudden paling cheek, while she said to herself, in dismay:</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no, he is not engaged to her&mdash;he cannot
be! He loves me&mdash;me only!&mdash;and he will surely
come and tell me so!”</p>

<p>“He said, my dear, that he was hoping to have a
lawn fête, too, very soon, to announce his engagement
to the sweetest and prettiest girl in New Market, if she
would have him, and he wanted her mother to ask
her to-night if she would. Now can you guess?” smiling
broadly.</p>

<p>“N-no, mamma!” faltered Berry.</p>

<p>“Why, then, you are very stupid, indeed, to-night,
and I never found you so before! Well, then, it’s
you, child, you, poor little Berry Vining, he wants to
marry, when he might aspire almost to the highest.
What a match for you, dearie! Aren’t you proud and
glad?”</p>

<p>Berry, stamping her little foot, cried out petulantly:</p>

<p>“Mamma, you must surely be going crazy! The idea
of marrying old Wilson, indeed! Older than my own
father, for he began as errand boy in Wilson’s shop,
and then old Wilson must have been white-headed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“He was not, you pert minx, he was only a young
married man, not more than ten years over your
father’s age! But what does that matter, when he’s a
widower now, worth a hundred thousand dollars, and
willing to stoop to marry a poor girl whose father
drove his delivery wagon, and whose mother works by
the day in the shop to take care of you!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t marry the old blear-eyed miser if every
hair of his head were gold and strung with diamonds,
but you may take him yourself, mamma, if you want
him so badly in the family!” cried Berry, with mocking
laughter.</p>

<p>“I only wish he would give me the chance, since you
are such a fool!” angrily replied the disappointed
mother, who craved the ease and comfort for her old
age that Mr. Wilson’s money would give to herself and
pretty, thoughtless Berenice.</p>

<p>She flung herself down on the kitchen lounge for her
usual evening nap after tea, and her daughter, still
laughing at the ridiculous suit of her aged wooer, hastened
outdoors to the front gate to watch every passer-by
with a throbbing heart, in the eager hope of his coming&mdash;his,
her lover, for she would call him that in
spite of a hundred Rosalinds! It was false what they
said of his betrothal to the proud, rich beauty, with
her flax-gold hair and bluebell eyes. She could never<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
believe it, never, after all that had passed to-day&mdash;the
bow, the flashing glance of love, the gift of the roses.
Presently he would be coming to tell her that he loved
her, and her alone.</p>

<p>It was one of those moonlight nights in early September,
that seem like June. The full moon shone in
a cloudless sky, sown thick with stars; the air was
warm and fragrant, and seemed to pulsate with love.
Every girl remembers how on such a night she has
hung over the front gate, gowned in white, with a rose
in her hair, waiting and watching for a lover dearer
to her heart than all the world beside!</p>

<p>Berenice did not watch long in vain, for it was a
true presentiment that told her the idol of her heart
was coming.</p>

<p>Men and women passed and repassed for almost an
hour, but at last her heart leaped with subtle ecstasy,
for one paused and stood in front of her, gazing down
with a smile into her starry eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Vining, good evening!” cried a musical
voice. “You see, I have found out your name. Mine
is Charley Bonair. Do you remember me?”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SWEETHEARTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Remember him? ah!</p>

<p>Berry could have laughed aloud at the tender question.</p>

<p>She knew that she could never forget his glance
and smile of this morning her whole life long.</p>

<p>Yet, with her pretty head poised, coquettishly, on one
side, and her eyes half veiled under their shady lashes,
she faltered demurely:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;believe you are the same gentleman that
passed with Miss Montague this morning, and bowed
to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” he answered, with a soft laugh,
as he leaned his elbows on the gate with his face very
close to her, while he continued tenderly:</p>

<p>“And from the first moment I saw your lovely face I
could not get you out of my mind. I asked Miss
Montague who was that pretty young girl, and she
frowned at me, and said: ‘There’s not a pretty face
that can escape you, Charley; but that is only little
Berry Vining, the daughter of a poor tailoress, not
in our set at all, so don’t ask for an introduction.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>Berry’s cheeks grew hot, and her heart thumped with
anger as she said to herself:</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you out for that, my proud lady, by taking
him away from you!”</p>

<p>Handsome Charley Bonair continued wheedlingly:</p>

<p>“As I couldn’t get properly introduced to you, I
thought I’d present myself. I see you are wearing
some of my roses.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for them; I love roses dearly,”
murmured Berry, in shy bliss, her head in such a
whirl under his laughing, ardent glance, that she hardly
knew whether she was standing on her head or on her
feet.</p>

<p>In his black evening suit, and a white carnation in
his buttonhole, he was superbly handsome, and carried
with him that subtle aroma of wealth and position so
alluring to a poor girl brought for the first time in contact
with uppertendom. It was as if a being from another
sphere, a distant star, had fallen at her feet,
stooping to lift her to his dazzling height.</p>

<p>Trembling with mingled pride and love and joy, she
looked up at him with her heart in her eyes, her tender
secret plain as day to him, almost too easy a conquest
to the blasé young man of the world.</p>

<p>But he continued to smile very tenderly at her, and<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
venturing to clasp her little hand as it clung to the top
of the fence, he said:</p>

<p>“I am due at the Montagues’ lawn fête presently,
but will you come with me for a little spin in my run-about
first? It is just around the corner, and this is
the finest night I ever saw for a moonlight drive.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall be delighted&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I must ask
mamma first,” declared the happy girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, for explanations would delay our drive,
since I must soon be back to the hall. We will be
home before she knows we are gone. Only a two-mile
spin, dear little girl,” pleaded the tempter, pressing
her little hand.</p>

<p>She thought:</p>

<p>“Mamma is asleep by now, and it would be a pity
to arouse her from her nap. Surely there’s no harm
in going, as I shall be back before she misses me!
And I shall so like to have this triumph over proud
Miss Montague, who tried to belittle me in his dear
eyes.”</p>

<p>He saw that she was yielding, and, unlatching the
gate, quickly drew her outside, placing her small, trembling
hand on his arm, and leading her to the waiting
trap.</p>

<p>A moment more, and he was lifting her into the
elegant little trap, drawn by a magnificent blooded bay<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
horse, whose silver-mounted harness glittered in the
moonlight. Seating himself by her side, he took up
the reins, and away they went through the town and
out upon the broad country road, where the air, with
the salty tang from the sea, was fresh and sweet and
exhilarating.</p>

<p>“Almost seems like eloping, does it not?” laughed
Charley Bonair. “What if it were so, dear little
girl?”</p>

<p>Berry caught her breath with a startled gasp, a
dizzy suspicion running through her mind.</p>

<p>Did he mean it?</p>

<p>Was it an elopement sure enough? Was he taking
her away to marry her, now, to-night?</p>

<p>What would Rosalind Montague say?</p>

<p>She never dreamed of resisting if such were his
will.</p>

<p>Poor little Berry was under the intoxicating spell
of a maiden’s first love, and it did not seem to her as
if her splendid hero could do anything wrong.</p>

<p>The bay horse flew over the smooth road, the fresh
air blew in their faces, lifting the soft curls from
Berry’s white brow, and she felt like one in Elysium.
She was dwelling in a new and beautiful world, the
golden land of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>Yet, when her companion gently attempted to slip
an arm about her waist, she decisively repulsed him.</p>

<p>“No, no; you must not make so free&mdash;we are almost
strangers,” she exclaimed, blushing warmly.</p>

<p>“Strangers! Why I love you, little girl! Cannot
you love me a little in return?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>Berry was about to answer him yes, taking this for
a proposal of marriage, when she suddenly remembered
the gossip about his betrothal to Rosalind, and drawing
back, she faltered tremulously:</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;they say that you are engaged to marry
Miss Montague!”</p>

<p>“Bah! What has that to do with your being my
sweetheart, I wonder; she need not know about it,”
laughed Charley Bonair, leaning as close to her as she
would permit, for she was recoiling in perplexity, murmuring:</p>

<p>“But is it true?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, little one, I’m to marry her some day,
I suppose! Deuced pretty girl, you know, and in ‘my
set,’ and all that&mdash;very proper, of course. But I mean
to have as many sweethearts as I like, before and after
the wedding, if you please!”</p>

<p>If he had thrust a knife in her tender heart Berry
could not have moaned more piteously, for all at once
he seemed to her a monster instead of an adorable<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
Prince Charming. With that heartbreaking little
moan, she cried plaintively:</p>

<p>“Oh, take me home, take me home quickly! Please,
please, please!”</p>

<p>And though the moon and stars still gleamed on as
brightly as before, it seemed to her tortured mind as
though the whole sky were veiled in inky darkness, and
her dream of love and happiness had faded as before a
chilling wintry blast.</p>

<p>He had told her he was indeed to marry Rosalind,
but that he should continue to have as many sweethearts
as he pleased! He dared even think she would
consent to be one of them!</p>

<p>She began to tremble like a wind-blown leaf, and
as he only laughed in answer to her pleading, she
added wildly:</p>

<p>“You are cruel; you are wicked, to be making love
to me when you are to marry another! I will have no
more to do with you, so there, there, there!” and tearing
the roses from her breast and hair, Berry flung
them in his face with the passionate fury of “the
woman scorned.”</p>

<p>“You dear little vixen!” he exclaimed, boisterously,
without turning back.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LEGITIMATE GAME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>To the gay young gallant, Berry’s anger only made
her more charming. She had seemed too easy a prize
before, for he had read her heart very quickly by the
light of former experiences.</p>

<p>A millionaire senator’s only son, and not many years
older than Berry, he looked upon this poor young girl
who had fallen in love with him so easily as only legitimate
game if he could win her heart.</p>

<p>Like a flash, it came to him with her bitter words
that she could not be so lightly won, that she was
proud and pure as she was fair.</p>

<p>The realization of this fact only made her more
interesting. Now he swore to himself he would not
relinquish the pursuit. There would be more zest
in it thus.</p>

<p>So he only laughed at her entreaties to turn back,
only laughed as the roses pelted his face and stung him
with their thorns, only urged the bay to a greater speed,
until Berry, her brief anger passed, suddenly crouched
in her seat, sobbing forlornly, in woe and grief:</p>

<p>“Oh, why did I come? What made me so foolish?<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
Hadn’t I always been told that rich young men had
little use for poor girls, only to rob them of their happiness!
Oh, Heaven, spare me from this wretch, and
send me safely back to poor mamma!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, little darling, don’t be so foolish,”
coaxed Charley Bonair. “Don’t you know I wouldn’t
harm one hair of that pretty little head! Why, I only
brought you out for a pleasant drive, and presently I’ll
take you home safe to your mamma. Maybe I was
rather mistaken in you at first, and thought you would
be my little sweetheart for the asking. But I surely
know better now, and I own I respect you more for it.
Come, come, little girl, let us be friends again! Haven’t
I been honest with you? Don’t I own my engagement
to Rosalind, although ’pon honor, I almost like
you better. But I couldn’t marry you, darling, even
if I were free of Rosalind, for my proud, rich father
and sisters would never forgive us the mésalliance; and
my father would withdraw my allowance, and we
should be poor as church mice; see?”</p>

<p>He had spoken gayly, but earnestly, and Berry, who
had ceased her sobbing to listen to him, faltered, softly:</p>

<p>“If I loved any one very much I could be happy
with him, even if we had not a cent in the world!”</p>

<p>The bashful avowal half sobered his gayety, and he
exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean that for me, little one? That you
could love me penniless, could marry me if the old dad
cut me off with a shilling, and be happy with me
on bread and cheese and kisses?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could,” declared Berry ardently, forgetting in
the passion of pure, first love all her ambitious dreams
for the future. In a moment his arm slipped around
her waist, and he drew her to him, crying recklessly:</p>

<p>“I’ll take you at your words, sweetheart; I’ll marry
you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“How dare you kiss me?” Berry cried, fighting him
off with her weak, white hands. “Take your arm
from my waist! You cannot deceive me with false
vows. You are going to marry Rosalind Montague,
who has your promise.”</p>

<p>“Bad promises are better broken than kept. I’ll
marry you, my little darling, and tell Rosalind to find
another husband!” Bonair answered, with another
reckless laugh, still speeding his horse onward, though
they were miles and miles away from home by this
time, out in the open country, where houses were few
and far between.</p>

<p>“I will not listen to your false promises. Oh, take
me home, if you have the least regard for me! I did
wrong to come, I know, but take me back before
mamma misses me!” entreated Berry, clutching his arm<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
with hysterical energy, tears raining down her pallid
cheeks.</p>

<p>All at once she had lost faith in him, and his kisses
had frightened her with their fervor, as she realized
by the light of the words he had spoken the vast distance
between their positions: he, the millionaire senator’s
son; she, the daughter of the poor tailoress. No,
no, he could never stoop to her, she could never drag
him down&mdash;he was for Rosalind, his equal. As for
her, life was over&mdash;she loved him so she could never
love another, but she must die of her despair.</p>

<p>But Charley Bonair kept on laughing at her wild entreaties.</p>

<p>“Not yet&mdash;not yet!” he cried hilariously, while he
urged the bay on, and still onward under the silvery
moonlight. “Listen, Berry, I have a clever plan to
humiliate Rosalind and cause her to break the engagement
so that I may marry you: I shall take you back
to the lawn fête, and dance with you there as my
guest, with Rosalind and my haughty sisters. Oh, how
angry they will be! If they order you to leave I shall
defy them, and we will dance on and on, and Rosalind
will be furious, vowing she will never speak to me
again. How do you like my plan? Will you come with
me back to the hall now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never, never!” cried Berry, shrinking in horror<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
from his sensational proposition, frightened, eager to
escape.</p>

<p>“You shall!” laughed Bonair abruptly, turning his
horse’s head to return.</p>

<p>“I will not!” she shrieked indignantly, and rose to
her feet, reckless with despair. The next moment, to
his horror, she sprang over the wheel, out into the
rocky road, before he could lift a hand to prevent her.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE TURNING POINT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As long as he lived, Charley Bonair would never
forget that tragic moment.</p>

<p>All at once, the fumes of wine passed from his
brain, and left him sober and horrified, the heart sinking
like lead in his breast.</p>

<p>It flashed over his mind that Berry’s wild leap for
liberty, made just as he turned the vehicle around, could
hardly fail to result in her instant death on the rough
and rocky road.</p>

<p>A loud groan escaped his blanched lips, and he drew
the frightened horse swiftly back upon its haunches
that he might spring out to go to her assistance.</p>

<p>But the spirited animal, frightened out of all reason
by Berry’s leap, and his master’s wild cry of alarm,
now spurned control, and darted forward at headlong
speed, dragging the lines from Bonair’s hands,
so that the light trap rocked so wildly from side to side
he could barely keep his seat by clinging to the edges.</p>

<p>He felt himself rushing to instant death, and in his
horror over Berry’s fate, he did not greatly care,
though the instinct of self-preservation made him shout
aloud while he clung desperately to the swaying vehicle<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
that, after a mile or so of this tremendous rush,
became shattered into pieces, mercifully enough for
him, because he suddenly fell through the wreck to the
ground, miraculously unharmed. The maddened horse
still rushed forward with furious leaps, trying to rid
himself of the fettering shafts that clung and hindered
his flight.</p>

<p>He lay prostrate in the dust several moments,
bruised, battered, and shaken, but, luckily, with no
bones broken, so that presently he stood upright again,
the only living thing in sight upon the lonesome road.</p>

<p>The moon and stars shone down upon him coldly,
and the night winds seemed to reproach him in subtle
whispers.</p>

<p>“Where is she, the girl who trusted you, whose
tender faith you shattered with your reckless words?”
it seemed to say.</p>

<p>With a groan he looked backward, then retraced his
steps with difficulty, he was so shaken up from the
shock and the fall.</p>

<p>But he knew that he must find her, dead or alive,
must restore her to her home, for which she had
pleaded pitifully.</p>

<p>There was a great ache, deep down in his heart,
a passionate repentance for his folly, a dawning love
greater than any he had ever known in his wild career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“If Heaven would listen to such a sinner, I’d pray
to find her, living and unhurt,” he thought wildly.
“Surely if my unworthy life could be spared, hers
should be! Dear, little, innocent Berry!”</p>

<p>Toiling wearily and anxiously along the road, he
regained the spot where Berry had sprung to her fate.
With a wild heart-throb he saw her white figure lying
prone on the ground.</p>

<p>“Not dead! oh, not dead!” he prayed wildly, as he
bent over the prostrate form.</p>

<p>Still and white, and seemingly lifeless, she lay, poor
little girl; but placing his hand above her heart, he
felt a faint, irregular flutter that assured him of life.</p>

<p>He looked wildly about for assistance, his pale face
transfigured with joy.</p>

<p>“Berry, dear little Berry, speak to me,” he cried
fondly; but there was no reply.</p>

<p>The dark lashes did not lift from the pallid cheeks,
the sweet lips did not open to answer his pleading cry,
the little hand he clasped seemed already cold with
approaching death.</p>

<p>“Oh, if some one would happen along! If I only
had a vehicle!” he groaned, sweeping his glance up and
down the lonely road for a sign of life anywhere.
But there was neither man nor house in sight, only<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
unbroken vistas of trees lining the dreary road, and in
the distance the prolonged baying of a hound that sent
an evil shudder along his veins.</p>

<p>They were at least five miles from town, and he remembered
with sickening self-reproach how he had
promised Berry that it should be so short a drive, not
over two miles at the longest.</p>

<p>“My accursed selfishness and vanity caused it all!
If she dies, her death lies at my door,” was the thought
that beat upon his bewildered brain.</p>

<p>Every moment of unconsciousness brought her death
nearer and nearer; he realized it with cruel force.
“Ah, Heaven, what should I do?” he cried, kneeling
over her there in the dusty road, marveling even
in his remorse and grief at the fairness of her pallid
face.</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do&mdash;he must carry her
back to town in his arms, since there was no other
way.</p>

<p>Like Richard the Third, he could have cried out:
“My kingdom for a horse!”</p>

<p>Realizing all the bitterness of his plight, he bent
down and took Berry’s limp figure in his arms and
started out to trudge the distance back to town.</p>

<p>Ordinarily this would have been no great feat, for
Charley Bonair was an athlete of renown among his<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
fellows. But he had got such a severe shaking up
himself, besides partially spraining his ankle, that he
was not very fit for the burden he now started out
to carry.</p>

<p>He trembled under the weight of Berry, and the
perspiration ran down his face in streams, while he
had to hide his lips to suppress groans of agony, as
the weak ankle now and then twisted under him so that
he could barely proceed.</p>

<p>But he set his teeth, grimly, vowing:</p>

<p>“I shall take her home if I die for it. It is the only
atonement I can make for my sin. How dared I think
I could flirt with this pure, sweet little darling!”</p>

<p>He thought with wonder of her exquisite innocence
and ignorance, of how surely she had believed at first
that he really wished to marry her when she was so
far beneath him in the social scale.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget her pride and anger when I
showed her my real nature,” he thought ruefully. “Ah,
what a strong sense of honor! How it put me to
the blush! She is too good for me, sweet little Berry!
It is better to marry Rosalind, who knows all my faults,
doubtless, and is not very saintly herself.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused in distress, and looked about
him.</p>

<p>The moon had gone under a dark cloud, the air<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
had turned chill, a flurry of rain beat down upon him,
groping in thick darkness with that dead weight in
his arms. It was one of the sudden changes in September
weather, capricious as April.</p>

<p>“We must get under shelter, somehow, somewhere!”
he thought, looking toward the trees, then a cry of joy
shrilled over his lips.</p>

<p>Among the trees he saw a light flare up like a
precious jewel in the gloom. It came from the windows
of a house.</p>

<p>He staggered toward it, drenched with rain, agonized
at every step with his sprained ankle, and his mind in
a tumult. How he gained the porch he scarcely knew,
but he saw that it was a sort of tavern.</p>

<p>He stumbled on the steps and fell prone with his
lovely burden.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE BOOK OF FATE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hello! What is this? Looks romantic!” cried a
gay, female voice, as the owner ran forward, followed
by several curious people, who united in concern
for the drenched and hapless strangers thus cast
upon their care.</p>

<p>With lively ejaculations of wonder, they got the pair
into a large, shabby sitting room, where a troupe of
stage people were making merry.</p>

<p>The most warm-hearted people on earth, they began,
without any questions, to relieve their guests. Presently
Bonair was able to explain reservedly:</p>

<p>“I was driving out with that young lady, a friend
of mine, when my horse became frightened and ran
away, throwing us both out. The accident happened
about a mile back, and I carried the young girl in my
arms, hoping to find a doctor somewhere.”</p>

<p>“There is one in the house and he has already
gone to her assistance,” they told him.</p>

<p>“Tell him to save her life at whatever cost. I
would give my own life to save that girl,” he cried
anxiously, causing a sympathetic smile all around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>No one blamed him, for one look at Berry’s lovely
face seemed to them sufficient excuse for the greatest
devotion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they found Bonair needing attention,
also, for his injured foot was rapidly swelling and
causing pain. The doctor came in presently and gave
it the necessary attention, saying that his patient was
reviving, and would presently be herself again, he
hoped. There were some superficial bruises, but he
hoped there was no internal injury.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” cried Bonair fervently, pressing a
roll of bills into the physician’s hand, while he added:</p>

<p>“If a covered vehicle can be had, I would like to
take the young girl home to her mother, who may be
uneasy at her delay.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, that will be most imprudent; I
should not like my patient to be moved until to-morrow.
As for you, you might send word to her mother
to come here.”</p>

<p>The young fellow shrank a little. He wondered how
Mrs. Vining would take the news. He would doubtless
get a sound berating from the old woman.</p>

<p>“But I have fully deserved it, and I will take my
punishment like a man,” he thought grimly, and ordered
the vehicle to be got ready quickly.</p>

<p>“There is a terrible storm raging&mdash;it is equinoctial<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
weather, you know. Better wait till it clears up,” they
said.</p>

<p>“No, I will not wait, if a man can be found to
drive me. That poor mother will be very anxious,”
he answered firmly.</p>

<p>In the teeth of the driving storm they set forth, but
Charley Bonair never reached his destination.</p>

<p>The driver, a sulky-looking fellow, who had observed
Bonair’s display of money at the inn, as well as
his diamond ring, assaulted and robbed his passenger
on the way to town, and left him for dead upon the
highway.</p>

<p>When found the next morning, there was indeed but
little life left in him&mdash;not enough to recognize any
one, or to remember aught that had happened. Life
became a blank to him for many days.</p>

<p>The return of his horse to the stable with the fragments
of the trap clinging to the harness told what
had happened to him, and no one suspected that a
beautiful young girl had been his companion on that
mad ride.</p>

<p>He could not speak and tell the story, for he lay ill
and unconscious many days, and none guessed that the
strange and continued disappearance of Berry Vining
lay at his door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>The mother herself had found a plausible reason for
her daughter’s absence.</p>

<p>She believed that Berry had fled in anger over their
quarrel that night, dreading lest she should be coerced
into a marriage with the merchant tailor.</p>

<p>“We had a quarrel, and I believe she ran away in
a fret. No, I don’t think she has committed suicide.
Berry wasn’t that kind of a girl,” she said, adding
hopefully, “she has maybe gone and got a situation in
a store in New York, and will write to me when she
gets over her mad spell.”</p>

<p>The neighbors accepted this view of the matter, and
no one could gainsay it. Mrs. Vining’s misfortunes
with her children were an old story! She was always
bewailing the disappearance of her handsome son by
a former marriage: a son who had deserted her and
gone none knew where.</p>

<p>Berry did not return, and no tidings came of her,
but the deserted mother kept on at her work in patient
sadness, hoping and praying for the welfare
of her headstrong child, though too poor to make a
search for the truant.</p>

<p>Thus the hand of Fate abruptly closed the first
chapter in the acquaintance of Charley Bonair and the
pretty village maid.</p>

<p>For when he recovered memory and consciousness<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
far into October, they told him weeks had elapsed
since he had been thrown from his trap and nearly
killed, and that only the most skillful nursing had
saved his life.</p>

<p>No one could answer the mute question in his eyes,
for the secret of that night had never transpired,
though he wondered how it had been so, saying to himself
that Berry was a girl in a thousand to have held
her tongue over such an accident.</p>

<p>“It is better so,” he said to himself, in keen relief,
yet he resolved he would write her a note of thanks,
which he hastily did, only to get it returned with the
information that Miss Vining was gone away.</p>

<p>When cautious inquiries brought out the reputed
facts of her disappearance, he was dazed with wonder.
He made a secret trip to the old inn, but he
found it closed and uninhabited.</p>

<p>It was a very bad moment that came just then to
handsome, reckless Charley Bonair.</p>

<p>He was terrified at the mysterious disappearance of
the winsome little beauty. He asked himself in an
agony what had been her fate, cursing himself for
having left her at the inn that night.</p>

<p>“What did I know of those people there? How
dared I leave her unprotected among them? Judging
from the fellow that robbed and nearly murdered<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
me that night, the whole gang must have been rough
and dangerous. Ah, little one, what has been your
cruel fate?” he groaned to himself, tormented by the
mystery that was so hard to fathom, because he dared
not make any public hue and cry through fear of
betraying Berry’s wild ride with him that, if known,
must inevitably compromise her in every one’s eyes,
despite her innocence.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that he went, privately,
to a detective, and saying nothing of his real purpose,
employed him to find out where the people had gone
who kept the inn.</p>

<p>The owner of the house was found, and reported
that the tenant, an old man, had died of apoplexy
a month before. His servants were scattered and
could not be found.</p>

<p>The identity of the theatrical troupe was next inquired
into, and soon learned to be the Janice James
Company. They could not be traced now, only in so
far as that they had disbanded and scattered, some
joining other companies, others going back to their
homes, so that Bonair’s next move through the detective
was to offer a reward through the personal
columns of the New York papers for information regarding
any member of the troupe. But weeks elapsed
without bringing any reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>Not even to the detective did Bonair confide his
real motive for his quest. A new respect and tenderness
for the girl he had tried to trifle with filled
his mind, and made him as tenacious of her good name
as if she had been his sister or his wife.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A SUSPECTED RIVAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“You may laugh at me for a superstitious girl,
mamma,” declared beautiful Rosalind Montague, “but
I shall always believe that postponements in love are
ill-omened. Ever since the night of the lawn fête, when
my lover failed to appear, and the fête was broken up
by the sudden rainstorm that drenched all our pretty
gowns, I have seen that something has gone wrong
between Charley’s heart and mine. Do you know,
mamma, he has never loved me the same, since his long
illness?”</p>

<p>“Just your fancy, dear. To me it seems that he is
yet ill and nervous after his terrible experience with
his runaway horse that night. I have seen him start
and turn pale when no one was speaking, as if from
ghastly thoughts.”</p>

<p>“That is true, mamma, perfectly true, and he
shudders sometimes when I barely touch his hand, and
he is cold as ice to me, mamma, cold as ice. He seldom
comes here, only when I send for him, and he
never alludes to our engagement. Do you believe that
his illness can have dazed his brain, that he can have
forgotten?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>“It may be so&mdash;who can tell?” cried the proud old
lady in velvet and diamonds. “I would sound him
gently on the subject, Rosalind.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, I should not know what to say, how
to begin,” exclaimed the girl, with a slight blush.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is easy enough, dear&mdash;all roads lead to
Rome! Ask him if he has any preference where to
spend the honeymoon, or how long he is willing to
wait until the wedding&mdash;or if he does not think your
engagement ring is a little too loose&mdash;anything!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mamma, I’ll stir him up somehow, for
at present he is a very unsatisfactory lover. It almost
looks as if I have a rival!”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, dear, who could rival beautiful Rosalind
Montague, the belle of her set, who won the millionaire’s
son from a whole bevy of conspiring mammas
and daughters!”</p>

<p>Rosalind smiled complacently at the flattery, and
glanced at her reflection in the tall pier glass&mdash;a fair
reflection, indeed, of a stately blonde with masses of
flax-golden hair and large, blue eyes that could soften
with love or flash with anger till they looked like points
of blue steel. This delicate beauty, appropriately
gowned in rich attire, had indeed made Rosalind the
belle of her set, “the rose that all were praising.”</p>

<p>It was the most natural thing in the world for<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
Charley Bonair to fall victim to her charms, even if
his pretty sisters, her schoolmates, had not conspired
to bring it about, artfully throwing them together,
ably abetted by Rosalind and her scheming mamma.</p>

<p>He was one of the greatest catches in fashionable society&mdash;the
only son of the millionaire senator, and although
Madam Rumor said ungracious things of him&mdash;that
he was dissipated, profligate, libertine&mdash;what of
that? He would inherit several of his father’s millions,
and could cover his wife with diamonds if he
wished, so one must overlook the spots on the sun!
Rosalind knew that she could not get a perfect husband.</p>

<p>To do the pretty Bonair girls justice, they were
eager for the match, because they believed that marriage
would reform their brother. And who so suitable
a bride as Rosalind, their school friend, well-born,
well dowered, beautiful, queenly, and secretly
adoring the handsome prodigal!</p>

<p>So, among them all, they set a snare for Charley,
and tripped him up. His battered heart succumbed
easily. Rosalind had scored a triumph over all the
beauties! Both families were charmed, and looked
eagerly forward to the wedding day.</p>

<p>Right here was where Charley failed in loverlike
duty, for he neglected to ask his betrothed to set the<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
wedding day, apparently quite satisfied to make it a
long engagement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montague was not altogether pleased at his
lukewarmness. To offset it, she planned the lawn
fête to announce the betrothal. When the fact became
public property, he must name the day.</p>

<p>We have seen how fate stepped in between and foiled
their plans, and how the ominous shadow of that
night’s disappointment hung over Rosalind’s ambitious
hopes.</p>

<p>“What has put this notion of a rival in your head,
dear girl?” continued the mother curiously.</p>

<p>Rosalind hesitated a moment, and a cold, angry glitter
shone in her eyes, as she whispered:</p>

<p>“Mamma, of course I know the hard things that are
said of Charley&mdash;that he is fond of cards, women, and
wine. Well, I happen to know that the very day of our
fête, even by my very side, my lover was attracted
by a new beauty, and could not hide his admiration.”</p>

<p>“A new beauty&mdash;who?” demanded Mrs. Montague
uneasily.</p>

<p>“You will be startled, mamma, but you will see that
I am not jealous without a cause. Listen,” and Rosalind
poured out the story of the morning ride when
Charley Bonair had bowed to and admired little Berry
Vining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“He said, to my very face, that she was the prettiest
girl he ever saw, but I told him how poor and humble
she was, and ridiculed his fancy. I found out afterward
that he rode back from my side to the florist’s,
and sent her a great bunch of red roses. Was not that
enough to make any engaged girl angry and jealous,
mamma?”</p>

<p>“I must admit you are quite right, darling. Oh,
what wretches men are!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and naturally after that I was jealous
and suspicious. When he did not come that night I
was almost wild, wondering if I was deserted already
for the little village beauty. I did not sleep that night
for anger and grief, though I was too proud to tell
you until now, when I can no longer bear my trouble
alone, because I am haunted always by two torturing
questions.”</p>

<p>“What are they, my love?”</p>

<p>“One is this, mamma: ‘What became of that girl
when she disappeared so suddenly from home that
night? And&mdash;did Charley Bonair know anything of
her flight?’”</p>

<p>“You suspect him of treachery?”</p>

<p>“Have I not cause? How strangely she fled from
home! How lame were her old mother’s guesses at
the truth! No girl could be forced to marry a rich<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
old man against her will. Then again, mamma, how
strange that Charley should be taking a ride miles out
into the country that night, when he was overdue at
our fête, where he was to be the guest of honor.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a detective, Rosalind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, do not ridicule me,” the girl clasped
her white hands, imploringly. “Think how much I
love him, how much I have at stake! I have puzzled
out all this in torturing nights when I could not sleep
for jealous pain.”</p>

<p>The proud woman of the world looked at her beautiful
daughter, and a deep sigh escaped her lips. Stifling
it with a sarcastic smile, she answered:</p>

<p>“It is the way of the world, my dear; men are
wicked, and women are weak. It may be as you suspect,
that he had a fancy for the girl, but you need not
worry over that; you are the one he will marry, and
he will tire of her and put her aside before your wedding
day.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, I hate her! I would gladly see her
dead, the little hussy! How dare she accept his love,
knowing, as all the town knows, that he belongs to
me! And who would have believed such a thing of
little Berry Vining, who seemed such a good, innocent
little thing!”</p>

<p>“Those good little girls like Berry are just the ones<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
to be deceived and ruined by designing men, child.
But put it out of your thoughts, love, do. We cannot
alter the world nor mankind, and all I can say
to you is that it’s better not to brood over imaginary
troubles. Bonair shall marry you, darling, never fear.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LOVED AND HATED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Time put his sickles in among the days,” and the
weeks slipped away and brought winter weather.</p>

<p>But long before the first snow, Charley Bonair had
gone away from New Market, ostensibly for a yachting
trip with some of his bachelor friends, leaving
Rosalind piqued and angry.</p>

<p>For when she had asked him point-blank how long
he wanted to wait before the wedding, he had answered
debonairly, that she might take all the time she
wanted. He guessed that both were young enough to
wait a while. Anyhow, he wanted to have this bachelor
trip with the boys before he thrust his neck into the
matrimonial noose!</p>

<p>Rosalind, secretly furious at his indifference, was on
the point of telling him to go and stay forever, but she
bit the tip of her rosy tongue, keeping back the sharp
retort, and half sobbed instead:</p>

<p>“Oh, Charley, I shall miss you so!”</p>

<p>“I should hate to think that you were lonely, dear,
but I don’t believe you will be, for Lucile and Marie
intend to have you with them in California for the
winter months, after Christmas. Will you go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>“Gladly, if you will promise to join us there when
you come back.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bargain,” he answered, laughing, but none
of her entreaties could prevail on him to fix the date
of his return.</p>

<p>He did not really know, he said. It would depend on
the other fellows. Meanwhile she was to enjoy herself
in her own way; he would not find fault nor get
jealous!</p>

<p>When he had gone away, she loved and hated him
by turns, and she was more than ever sure that Berry
Vining had stolen his heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could find her, and were quite, quite sure
of her guilt, I would wreak a bitter vengeance,” she
murmured angrily, to the silent walls of her luxurious
chamber.</p>

<p>She would have given anything to know the whereabouts
of the girl she believed to be her rival.</p>

<p>It nearly maddened her to think that Charley might
be seeing her daily, basking in her smiles, laughing
with her, perhaps, over the deferred wedding. Her
hatred of the young girl grew each day, until it became
a passion for revenge.</p>

<p>“My day will come! Let her look to herself, that
day!” she vowed bitterly.</p>

<p>She went one day to the cottage on pretense of getting<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
a cloth suit pressed, and with pretended sympathy,
asked Mrs. Vining if she had ever had any news
of the missing girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vining wept as she declared that she had never
heard any news of her daughter.</p>

<p>“She may be dead and buried for aught I know
to the contrary, Miss Montague.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she has eloped with a lover,” cried Rosalind,
but the old woman frowned, and answered
quickly:</p>

<p>“My girl was as pure and high-minded as the richest
young lady in the land, miss, and she would never stoop
to disgrace.”</p>

<p>“I hope it may prove so, indeed!” exclaimed Rosalind,
from the depths of her jealous heart, and she
went away, promising to send her maid with the tailor
gown to be pressed.</p>

<p>The little cottage with the morning-glory vines all
dead, looked dreary and deserted, and poverty-stricken;
but poor as it was, the good widow could barely pay
the rent. Rosalind could not help but think, as she
walked away, that it was a poor setting for the lovely
girl who had fled away from it rather than exchange it
for the gilded misery of a loveless marriage, such as
her mother had proposed.</p>

<p>One thing she had told Mrs. Vining earnestly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>“If you hear from your daughter, be sure and let
me know, and I will make it worth your while. I take
a deep interest in little Berry, you know.”</p>

<p>Aye, the interest of the hawk in the dove, proud
beauty! The mother curtsied in gratitude, and thanked
her for her kindness.</p>

<p>And just before Christmas she was startled to receive
a note from the tailoress, saying she had heard
from her little girl at last. She had run away to
be an actress, because life in New Jersey was too
dull and lonely. She had sent her mother a little
money and a pretty picture of herself, and begged her
not to be angry, but she was touring in California now,
and it would be a long time before she came home
again.</p>

<p>“In California&mdash;Charley’s own State. It looks suspicious,”
muttered Rosalind, and she went over to the
cottage to visit Mrs. Vining again.</p>

<p>But she did not find out anything more, for the letter
had been mailed on a train, and Berry failed, perhaps
by design, to tell her destination, adding in a
postscript:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I don’t ask you to write me, because I am always
‘on the go,’ but I have means you do not guess, of
sometimes hearing of your welfare.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<p>“It is through him,” Rosalind thought bitterly, but
she concealed her agitation, and congratulated the
widow, prettily, on having heard from her daughter.
Then promising to send her a handsome Christmas
gift, she took leave.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair would have given thousands of dollars
to know even what Rosalind had heard about
Berry; for he had begun to mourn her as dead, and
remorse stung like a serpent in his heart.</p>

<p>Always remembering that the man from the inn,
who had robbed and tried to murder him, belonged
to those people, he had decided they must all be cut-throats
and robbers, and that Berry had most likely
met her death at their hands.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart he landed from the yacht at San
Francisco, deciding he would join his family there,
and little dreaming the surprise awaiting him.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BLUE EYES AND BROWN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Senator Bonair’s palatial home in the magnificent
city of San Francisco was ablaze with light and gayety
that night.</p>

<p>Though the millionaire owner himself was absent, in
attendance on the session of Congress at Washington,
his two handsome daughters, with their aunt, who
chaperoned them since the death of their mother, had
preferred remaining at home this winter, and were entertaining
a house party. On this night they were
giving a grand ball, and neither time nor money had
been spared to make it a great success.</p>

<p>To make it more notable, the dancing was to be
preceded by a theatrical treat, a play given by actors
employed for the occasion. The private theater of the
mansion had been refitted for the event, and a superb
orchestra engaged.</p>

<p>To add to the pleasure of the evening, the manager
assured his employers that an entirely new play would
be given&mdash;one written by a member of his own company,
a lovely young girl, who would herself play the
leading part in her clever production, “A Wayside
Flower.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>All the invited guests were on the qui vive, for the
entertainments of the Bonairs always surpassed any
other given in the city, and hundreds of hearts of gay
young girls and happy swains fluttered in anticipation.</p>

<p>As the time approached for the curtain to rise, not
a seat in the small theater was vacant. Exquisite ball
gowns and jewels gleamed everywhere, while the bright
eyes of their wearers flashed upon their black-coated
companions with swift coquetry.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among all, in a gown of white lace
over azure satin, with rare pearls clasping her slender
throat, and binding her thick waves of flax-gold hair,
was Rosalind Montague, the honored guest of the
house, the betrothed of the senator’s only son.</p>

<p>Rosalind had never looked more beautiful, and one
who was gazing at her from an obscure seat, an uninvited,
unexpected guest, could not help but acknowledge
it in his heart with a thrill of pride.</p>

<p>“Poor Rosy, I don’t see why I cannot love her better!
She will make a bride to be proud of when I conclude
to settle down and become a benedict.”</p>

<p>Why was it, as he gazed at her brilliant blue eyes
and sunny hair, that dark brown eyes and curly chestnut
locks came between him and Rosalind so persistently?
Why would not memory down, when it was
torture to remember!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>She never could be his, the little brown-eyed cottage
maiden, who had scorned him for his light love,
and flung his roses back into his face. How the
thorns had stung, as well as the lash of her little
tongue, as she had berated him so soundly. Then when
she had flung herself so desperately from his vehicle
to almost certain death, could he ever forget that tragic
hour? He stifled a groan, and shrank back farther into
the shade of the tall palm near the door, where he
had slipped into an irregular seat not in the rows. Oh,
Heaven, what had been the mystery of her fate?
Since he could not fathom it, why could he not forget?
He must forget, he vowed, passionately to himself,
for by and by, when he became Rosalind’s husband,
it would be a sin to his blue-eyed bride for those haunting
brown orbs to come between.</p>

<p>When he landed first in the city a whim had made
him go first to a hotel, where, hearing of the entertainment
going on at home, he had gotten himself into
evening dress and arrived at the last moment, when his
sisters, already in the box with Rosalind and other
guests, were waiting, momently, for the curtain to
rise on the first act in the play. It would not do to
interrupt them now. Greetings must wait.</p>

<p>Anyhow, they were not missing him. Several men
were in the box with them, giving attention and receiving<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
it. He remembered he had told Rosalind he
should not care how much she flirted, and she was
taking him at his word.</p>

<p>The blue eyes as they looked upward to the dark-eyed
man bending so eagerly to them, were very tender
and languishing, and many a lover might have been
jealous, but Charley Bonair was not conscious of a
pang. Although he felt a certain pride and sense of
proprietorship in her beauty, he did not mind the other
fellow’s palpable admiration.</p>

<p>The chief thing that worried him now was that he
was haunted by other eyes&mdash;brown eyes, soft with
love, brown eyes, flashing with anger, always brown
eyes! “Eyes it were wiser by far to forget.”</p>

<p>Again he stifled a long-drawn sigh, and glanced at
the curtain, for the blare of the orchestra had begun,
and presently the play would be on. He remembered
just then to look at the elegant program the usher
had thrust into his hand.</p>

<p>He had barely time to see that the play was entitled
“A Wayside Flower,” when the orchestra ceased, and
the curtain rolled up, showing the first scene.</p>

<p>He caught his breath with a gasp, and rubbed his
eyes with a bewildered hand, then looked again to see
if his vision had played him false.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A TRAGEDY OF LOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>One easily guesses that “A Wayside Flower” was
the story of a young girl&mdash;beautiful, but poor.</p>

<p>The rich hero’s fancy turned from his betrothed,
the proud beauty, his equal in wealth and station, to the
simple village maiden.</p>

<p>With all the arts of love he wooed her for his own.</p>

<p>When the maiden, pure as snow, turned in grief and
anger from the proffer of the heart without the hand,
he deceived her by a mock marriage, swearing her to
keep the secret.</p>

<p>In the distant village, where they spent their blissful
honeymoon, she somehow discovered through a
letter he had dropped that he was betrothed to another,
and the wedding day set.</p>

<p>Undreaming of treachery, yet grieved for her hapless
rival’s sorrow, <em>Daisy</em> reproached her young husband
for his flirtations, and insisted on his writing
at once to the young girl to break off as gently as possible
the engagement he could never now fulfill.</p>

<p>Carelessly assenting, <em>Chester</em> wrote the letter under
<em>Daisy’s</em> eyes, sealed and addressed it, and pretended
to have her post it to make sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>But he had cunningly slipped quite another sort of
letter into the envelope, and destroyed the one she
had seen him write.</p>

<p>By and by came the time when he must leave her
alone and return to his home, lest his rich father disinherit
him on finding out the truth of his marriage
to the village beauty.</p>

<p>He never returned.</p>

<p>For a while came letters filled with love and devotion,
and always inclosing money for the little wife.</p>

<p>Weary months slipped away, and brought the winter
snows. The deserted bride fell ill, and besought her
husband to return to her side.</p>

<p>Blank silence fell. No more letters, no more money.</p>

<p>In the simple cottage where she boarded, the people
began to hint at desertion. The villainous son showed
her loverlike attentions.</p>

<p>When <em>Daisy</em> repulsed him in anger he showed her
a letter from her husband that broke her heart.</p>

<p><em>Chester</em> had written to the villain that the girl was
not his wife. He had deceived her by a mock marriage.
Now he was weary of her, and would see her
no more. In fact, he was about to go abroad for years,
and if he, the villain, would marry the girl, he would
pay him handsomely to keep the whole thing quiet.</p>

<p>For the sake of her beauty and the bribe he was<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
offered, this poor apology for manhood was ready to
make <em>Daisy</em> an honest wife, but when she refused
him with biting scorn he made his weak mother thrust
her into the street, homeless and penniless in the winter’s
snow.</p>

<p><em>Daisy</em> pawned her simple jewels and journeyed back
to her deserted home and widowed mother, praying
only to die under the roof that had sheltered her
childhood and girlhood.</p>

<p>Then she heard that there was to be a grand wedding
up at the hall that night. Her false lover was
about to wed the beautiful heiress, his social equal,
his chosen mate.</p>

<p>Poor little <em>Daisy</em> had been plucked as carelessly as a
wayside flower, and thrown aside to die.</p>

<p>The poor old mother, half crazed by her daughter’s
shame and despair, cried bitterly:</p>

<p>“You have only yourself to blame, girl! I brought
you up to shun rich young men; I told you they had
no use for poor girls but to wreck their lives. You
would not believe what I told you, you laughed at my
warnings, and fled with the villain that ruined you.
Now you have returned to drag out a wretched existence
under the ban of scorn, while he goes scot-free
and weds another!”</p>

<p>The wretched <em>Daisy</em> knew that it was all true. She<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
shut herself into her room, and brooded over her trouble
till her brain went wild.</p>

<p>In the evening she came down to her mother, calm
with the calmness of a great despair.</p>

<p>“I have thought it all over, dear mother,” she said
gently. “I did wrong to come back to you in my trouble;
because you warned me and I would not listen. So
I have no right to stay here and cloud your life with
my shame and sorrow. I am going away forever.
Good-by, dear mother. Say that you forgive me before
I die!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, child? Where are you going?
What is this wild talk of dying? Come back, <em>Daisy</em>;
mother will forgive you,” cried the poor mother, but
<em>Daisy</em> had fled through the door out into the cold moonlight,
shining on a world that was white with snow.</p>

<p>“I must follow and bring her back. I scolded her
too harshly,” the mother cried, snatching her bonnet
and hastening after her child.</p>

<p>But her poor, rheumatic limbs could not keep pace
with <em>Daisy’s</em> flying feet. She could not overtake her
in time to prevent the tragedy.</p>

<p>The bridal cortège was moving out from the gates
of the hall, and some little children belonging to the
tenant were throwing flowers in front of the bridal<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
carriage as it started toward the church where the
fashionable throng was waiting.</p>

<p>The clear moonlight and lamplight showed <em>Chester’s</em>
face plain as day, as he sat by the side of the
bride.</p>

<p>With a cry of reproach and despair that shrilled to
heaven, <em>Daisy</em> darted into the road, and flung herself
under the horses’ feet.</p>

<p>But <em>Chester</em>, sitting there, pale and handsome, on his
way to his wedding, had seen that lovely face upraised
to heaven as she darted forward, had heard that
terrible cry, and it pierced his false heart like an arrow.</p>

<p>He gave an answering cry, and tearing open the carriage
door, as the vehicle swayed under the driver’s
frantic efforts to throw the horses back on their
haunches, he sprang out and strove to tear <em>Daisy</em> from
under their desperate hoofs.</p>

<p>The maddened animals dragged the reins from the
driver’s hands, and their steel-clad hoofs came down
with a dull thud upon <em>Chester’s</em> and <em>Daisy’s</em> bodies as
they writhed on the ground.</p>

<p>It all passed more quickly than one could describe
it, and almost before the people in the next carriage
knew that anything was happening the ill-fated pair
were drawn from their terrible position, crushed and
dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>The frightened bride, reckless of her white gown
and slippers, sprang out into the snow.</p>

<p>“Oh, what has happened?” she cried, in wild alarm.</p>

<p>Then she saw <em>Chester</em> prone upon the ground, with
blood streaming from a cut in his head down over his
pallid face, while he held to his heart the slight figure
of an unconscious girl. The bride knew the pale face
instantly. It was the little cottage maiden, who had
eloped with a mysterious lover whose identity no one
knew.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>Chester</em>, what does this mean? What has happened
to you?” demanded the bride wildly, and turning
his heavy eyes on her face, he groaned:</p>

<p>“<em>Geraldine</em>, I have sacrificed my life to save this
poor girl!”</p>

<p>“Why did you do it? What is she to you?” fiercely.</p>

<p>Like an arrow from a bow straight to her heart came
his answer:</p>

<p>“The truth is cruel to you, <em>Geraldine</em>, but I feel that
I am dying, so I must make a full confession. I deceived
this poor girl with a mock marriage, then deserted
her, returning to make you my lawful bride.
Realizing her despair, she has returned and chosen to
die beneath my horses’ feet. I have given my life
vainly in the effort to save poor little <em>Daisy</em>.”</p>

<p><em>Geraldine</em> realized that people were crowding round<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
about her, that the white face of the “best man” was
close to hers, his arms shielding her from falling to
the ground, but she kept her eyes glued on that pale,
dying face, and her ears strained not to lose a sound
of that weak, dying voice.</p>

<p>“<em>Geraldine</em>,” he faltered on, “I meant to marry you
for wealth and position, but in my heart I loved <em>Daisy</em>
best. I was not worthy of your love, but I pray you
to forgive me, and to see that I am buried by the side
of the girl who was my wife in the sight of Heaven.”</p>

<p>He had thought little <em>Daisy</em> dead, but suddenly her
dim eyes flared open and rested adoringly on his face.
Her dulled hearing had caught words that made her
ineffably happy.</p>

<p>“Darling!” he muttered brokenly.</p>

<p>The best man stifled <em>Geraldine’s</em> cry of rage with a
daring hand upon her lips.</p>

<p>“Forgive him, dear, you shall not miss him,” he
whispered tenderly. “Do you remember how we loved
each other before that lovers’ quarrel, when he came
between? Now you know he was unworthy, let us
begin again, dear. Tell him you forgive and will do
his will.”</p>

<p><em>Geraldine</em> trembled at the warm touch of his hand,
and bending over <em>Chester</em>, gave the promise he asked.</p>

<p>“I forgive you; you shall rest side by side,” she faltered,<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
not a minute too soon, for in another moment
the lovers were both dead, clasped in each other’s
arms.</p>

<p>The first scene in “A Wayside Flower” showed
the heroine singing a love song at a window wreathed
in morning glories, and as Bonair gazed in wondering
agitation, he saw that the singer’s face was that of
little Berry Vining!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE CURTAIN FALLS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Clever little Berry had taken the one romantic chapter
out of her own life’s history and made a romance
out of it, such as her sad heart and simple experience
prompted&mdash;a trite little story enough, save for its tragic
ending.</p>

<p>And as she had considerable histrionic ability, she
was able to take the leading part with much credit to
herself, winning enthusiastic applause from her audience.</p>

<p>She could not have acted so cleverly had she known
under whose roof she was, and what eyes were gazing
on her lovely face as she entered with whole-souled
spirit into her part.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair stood apart to Berry in a little world
of his own. She scarcely connected him with the millionaire
senator of California, and his lovely sisters
she had never seen. It was only the home of a stranger
to her, this palatial house where she had come with
her company to act for the pleasure of the ball guests.</p>

<p>Life had been a whirl to Berry Vining since the
night when she had been carried senseless into the
company of actors, who, charmed by her exquisite<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
beauty, had easily persuaded her to join them on the
road. Gifted with much natural dramatic talent, she
had quickly “caught on” to the art, and now earned
a subsistence by her work. In this arduous life, too,
she could more easily put from her the memory of her
shattered love dream, so brief, so bitter-sweet.</p>

<p>Yet in quiet moments it returned to vex her soul,
so that she wove the beginning into a story of love and
sorrow that grew and grew until her morbid fancy
shaped it into a tragic romance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the death of the leading lady gave Berry
her position, and she had a chance to act her romance
on the boards of the Bonairs’ private theater.</p>

<p>It was easy to put her heart in it so wholly that the
audience seemed to her like so many lay figures, and
she dreamed not that Charley Bonair’s eyes watched
her, eagerly, from far back at the door, where an artificial
palm half hid him from sight, while from a
prominent box Rosalind Montague gazed in startled
wonder, almost as if Berry had risen from the dead.</p>

<p>For it must be the little village beauty, the coincidence
was too striking to admit of a doubt.</p>

<p>There sat the girl singing at the vine-wreathed
window, just as on that September morning, when the
gay cavalcade of riders went past, and Charley Bonair
had turned her curly little head with his flashing glance<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
and bow&mdash;singing, too, the same sweet lay of love and
longing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“My heart with joy would thrill if you loved me,
</div><div class="indent0">’Twould give this life of mine its fill of ecstasy;
</div><div class="indent0">Each golden moment spent with you on wings of Joy would flee;
</div><div class="indent0">The sky would be a ceaseless blue if you loved me.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The gift of the roses followed next, and as Rosalind
saw the fair girl in her white gown kissing the flowers,
and fastening them in her hair and breast, she trembled
with anger and jealousy.</p>

<p>“The little minx! She has dared make a play out
of her silly flirtation with Charley,” she thought; “she
dares even to play it in his own home, hoping to meet
his eyes again, but, thank Heaven, he is far enough
away from here, he will never know.”</p>

<p>If a look could have killed pretty Berry, she must
surely have fallen dead upon the boards, so deadly was
the hatred with which Rosalind watched her, for she
thought:</p>

<p>“It is just as I suspected between Charley and her,
the little hussy! He eloped with her, and, perhaps, was
with her until he went on that yachting trip to shake
off her fetters. It is doubtful if there was even any
pretense of a marriage between them. No doubt she
was eager enough to go without a wedding ring, thinking
of the money she could cajole out of her rich lover.<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
Oh, I see just how it is now! She is very clever, this
Berry Vining&mdash;she came here trying to win him back,
thinking he may have got home again! Oh, how glad
I am he is still away, for he would easily fall into her
toils if he were here, the weak fool, carried away by
every pretty face! How well she acts! I never
dreamed it was in that cottage girl, such cleverness in
writing a play, and then acting it. She is indeed a rival
to be dreaded, and I must do something to get rid of
her, that is clear. Even if Charley tired of her once,
he would love her again in this pretty play that shows
her off to so great advantage! Oh, what wretches men
are, as mamma says! How they make a girl’s heart
ache with jealousy over their fickle love! If I did not
love him myself, I would not care so much, but he’s
all the world to me, my Charley! What shall I do to
get rid of her before he returns to the city? If mamma
were here she would tell me not to mind, that it could
never come to aught but a light love. But I do mind;
I will not endure his unfaithfulness! If I thought no
one could even find me out, I believe I could almost
strike her dead before me, I hate her with such intense
fury!”</p>

<p>“Rosy, how strange you look! You are pale, and
your eyes gleam with blue fire. The poor girl’s trouble
seems to be getting onto your nerves! But she is<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
really a very clever actress, and enters well into the
part,” exclaimed Marie Bonair, with a suddenness that
made her start and tremble.</p>

<p>But she rallied herself, and murmured back:</p>

<p>“It’s really quite thrilling, and I almost forgot where
I was, dear. This was the third act, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m almost sorry; I have been so interested.
Every one else is, too. See how eagerly they
keep their eyes on the stage. Our play was a great
success. Well, we will soon come to the banquet, and
then the dancing. Do you know that we have spread
an elegant collation for the actors, too, in the small
dining room?”</p>

<p>“How very nice of you, Marie!” murmured Rosalind,
but to herself she added viciously:</p>

<p>“I wish I could poison that girl’s wine undetected! I
wish some of the stage properties would get on fire
and destroy her beauty, anyway. Oh, anything that
could happen to that girl would be welcome to me, so
that he never saw her face again.”</p>

<p>The fell spirit of murder had entered the jealous
girl’s heart!</p>

<p>The curtain rose again on the fourth act, and although
the introduction of horses on the stage was
a very difficult feat, still it was quite well done. The
lovers died, gracefully, in each other’s arms, and the<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
widowed bride clung fondly to the attentive best man.
In the vernacular of one of the troupe, the play had
been a “howling success.” The company was called
back to receive the plaudits of the spectators, and the
audience rose at the leading lady with enthusiasm, pelting
the little beauty with flowers and jewels.</p>

<p>But one man far back in the theater, hurried away
with his hat before his face.</p>

<p>“I hope no one has recognized me, for I really am not
fit to join my people to-night. I must get away and
collect my thoughts,” muttered Charley Bonair.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A PHANTOM AT DAWN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“An Indian seeress in an alcove off the western corridor
will tell everybody’s fortune.”</p>

<p>The whisper ran from lip to lip at the banquet table,
where the players were being feasted and wined by the
hospitable Bonairs.</p>

<p>The gay, impressionable people of the troupe were
charmed with the idea, and when they left the table
they went en masse to the alcove, chaperoned by the
housekeeper, who under orders from her mistress was
doing the honors.</p>

<p>As they were admitted one by one to the alcove, the
others, waiting in the magnificent corridor lined with
tall palms, statues, and pictures, strolled about, peering
into rooms and admiring the splendor of the palace
where they were for the moment sojourners.</p>

<p>The housekeeper, a portly, loquacious woman, kept
by Berry’s side, having conceived a liking for the lovely
actress.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the folks dancing in the
grand ballroom for a minute or two? Come, then, I’ll
give you a peep,” she said, leading the willing girl
quietly away from the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>The next thing they were out of doors, going along
a quiet alleyway bordered with fragrant blossoming
trees, and the sound of dance music came to them in a
wild blare of melody.</p>

<p>“Here now, look in at this window,” whispered the
woman.</p>

<p>Berry looked, and gasped:</p>

<p>“It must be fairyland!”</p>

<p>“’Tis grand, ain’t it, now?” replied the housekeeper.
She watched Berry’s dazed eyes taking in the immense
room with its costly fitting, tropical decorations, and
dazzling lights under which moved a hundred couples
in each other’s arms, to the tilt of the intoxicating waltz
music, and smiled at the young girl’s wonder.</p>

<p>“These Bonairs, you see, miss,” she explained, “are
the richest folks in California&mdash;what you call multi-millionaires&mdash;more
money than they know what to do
with! I’ve been housekeeper to them these twenty-five
years. I came when they were first married. I was
here when the senator’s three children were born, and
when his good wife died, and I expect to be here till I
die. Have you ever seen any of the Bonairs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, never!” Berry answered absently, and the
woman clacked on:</p>

<p>“Then I’ll point them out to you if they come in
sight. See that fat lady, with the velvet gown and diamonds,<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
and the white pompadour? That is old Madam
Fortescue, the senator’s widowed sister, who chaperoned
his two daughters, Misses Marie and Lucile,
great beauties, both of them, and both engaged to marry
rich New Yorkers. I think they mean to have a double
wedding in the fall. It will be a great affair, you know.
Their brother, Mr. Charley, is engaged, too, to a New
York belle and beauty, and she’s here now, the guest
of the house&mdash;Miss Montague! Why, what’s the matter,
miss? You startled so!”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, don’t mind me! Go on, please!” Berry
managed to articulate, feeling as if the earth had
heaved beneath her feet.</p>

<p>The truth had burst upon her so suddenly that only
by the greatest effort could she keep her self-possession.</p>

<p>With the utterance of Miss Montague’s name everything
became clear.</p>

<p>She was under the roof of Charley Bonair!</p>

<p>She clung with both hands to the window ledge to
hold herself steady, and listened with a dull roar in
her ears, while the woman continued:</p>

<p>“Mr. Charley, now, he’s away on a long yachting
trip, and dear knows when he will be back. They do
say he is sowing an awful crop of wild oats, poor
boy, but he’s good at heart, so he is. A dearer boy
when he was growing up, I never saw! And that fond<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
of pets, why he has a fine zoölogical collection on these
grounds here. You wouldn’t believe it, maybe, but he’s
even got two bear pits, miss, and in one of them the
bear has two new cubs. She’s that savage over them,
she would tear you to pieces if you touched one of
them! And birds and smaller animals, now, you’d be
surprised at the number. If you like to come here to-morrow,
I’ll take pleasure in showing you around. The
little bear cubs, my but they are cute! And to hear
Zilla, their mother, growling over them, it’s a wonder!&mdash;makes
cold chills run over one, sure enough!”</p>

<p>“They are running over me now!” gasped Berry,
clutching the woman’s hand with one that was as cold
as ice. “I&mdash;I must go. Please take me back to my
friends; they will be going back without me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, plenty of time, miss&mdash;you must stay till you
get your fortune told, sure.”</p>

<p>“Really, I don’t care. I mean, I’d rather not,” faltered
Berry, trembling all over with a sudden nervous
premonition of evil that shook her like an ague.</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t be scared at the old fortune teller, dear
miss, she may tell you something pretty,” urged the
good-natured woman, guiding the trembling girl back
to the corridor and the alcove, where the last one was
coming out, and the merry troupe were chattering like
magpies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, come, Miss Vane, she is waiting for you,” the
gay girls cried, pushing her in, and pulling to the curtains
behind her.</p>

<p>The horrible old Indian seeress enthroned among
draperies of Eastern tapestries, worth their weight in
gold, and hideous in theatrical red light, clutched the
girl’s white hand, and peering at the rosy palm, began
to mutter a sibilant jargon of fateful words.</p>

<p>And presently the actress, Vera Vane, who had risen
from the ashes of Berenice Vining, flung aside the draperies
and rushed from her presence, pale as a phantom
at dawn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN ILL-FATED GIRL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The merry actors and actresses all began to chaff
Berry on her pale face and frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“She is actually scared!” “What did the old hag tell
you, dear?” “She gave all of us fine fortunes!” they
chimed in together. But Berry put them aside with a
trembling hand, and sank, half fainting, into the nearest
seat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopson, the housekeeper, came to her rescue.</p>

<p>“Don’t pester the poor child till she gets over her
scare. Land sakes, miss, don’t take that nonsense to
heart, please. Them old Indian squaws don’t know
the future any better than you do!” she said kindly,
but Berry did not hear the well-meant words. She
had fainted.</p>

<p>When she came to herself she was lying on a cot in
Mrs. Hopson’s room, and all the others were gone.</p>

<p>“You were so long coming around I told them I’d
keep you all night, or send you back in a carriage when
you felt better,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are very kind. I&mdash;I think that I will go
presently, when I am a little stronger. But do not<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
let me, dear Mrs. Hopson, keep you from your duties.
I can lie here alone, please,” faltered Berry eagerly.</p>

<p>“Very good, my dear miss, for I have many things
to see to to-night, and I’ll be very glad to have you
for my guest till morning,” returned the good woman,
pressing a glass of wine on the young girl, and then
going out with a promise to be back in an hour.</p>

<p>Left alone, Berry lifted her head and glanced eagerly
at the clock.</p>

<p>“Midnight&mdash;it lacks half an hour to it yet. Oh, must
I keep that strange tryst or not? Am I indeed menaced
by so terrible a fate, and can this old Indian really prevent
the doom by the loan of so singular a charm as she
offers? It seems very foolish, but I have heard my
dear mother and her cronies often reiterate the same
thing&mdash;that a person born with a caul over the face&mdash;that
is to say, a thin membrane of skin that may be
dried and preserved&mdash;is the fortunate possessor of a
charm against drowning&mdash;that such a charm may be
bought or loaned, and always proves a safeguard. How
very strange; but there are many things we cannot understand!
And what was it the old fortune teller said
of me? I was fated to die a terrible death by water
in twenty-four hours, unless I could procure such a
charm. She possessed one herself that she would lend
me for one week, when the risk would be over, but she<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
must first go home and procure it, and she would meet
me in the grounds on the northern walk going to the
private zoo at the stroke of twelve. Shall I go? Is it
worth while living when one is alone in the world as
I am, for all my kindred now living are uncongenial
to me, and there can never be any love story for poor,
deceived Berry, who gave her heart too easily at first,
but can never take it back again?”</p>

<p>With a bursting sob, the girl pushed back the heavy
locks from her forehead, murmuring on:</p>

<p>“Can it be true, as that old hag assured me, that my
dear, dear mother is dead? But she read my palm like
an open book. I can see her yet peering into my palm,
hear her cracked, sepulchral voice mouthing such dreadful
words: ‘Little girl, your rosy palm has all the
secrets of your life clearly written there. You have
drunk deep of the cup of love, but the dregs were bitter;
you looked above you for a lover, but you had a
beautiful rival, a high-born lady, who held his heart
and his hand. Hopeless of ever winning your heart’s
idol, and destined by your mother to a marriage for
money, you deserted your home, and fled far away with
new friends. Is it not so?’”</p>

<p>“You have spoken the truth,” sobbed hapless Berry.
“Oh, I did not dream you could find all that in the
palm of my hand. But now you have told me of the<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
past, read me the story of my future. Tell me what
awaits the most ill-fated girl in the world.”</p>

<p>“You may well say ill-fated,” croaked the hag, still
clutching the little white hand, and peering into its lines
as one reads an open book; “I read horror upon horror
here, and&mdash;it is better not to know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell me all,” cried Berry recklessly; “go on,
go on!”</p>

<p>With a heartless chuckle the seeress muttered:</p>

<p>“Before I touch on the impending tragedy of your
future I must return to the past. The old mother who
loved you so dearly, whom you deserted so cruelly in
her old age&mdash;that old mother lies dead!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no!” sobbed Berry, sinking to her
knees in despair.</p>

<p>“It is true,” croaked the sibyl. “She lies dead, and
her last word was a curse upon your wicked head.”</p>

<p>“Not wicked; oh, no&mdash;only weak and suffering,”
moaned the girl. “Oh, mother, now I have indeed
nothing to live for, nothing to love.”</p>

<p>“That is just as well, girl, for fate hangs heavy
over your head,” croaked the hag.</p>

<p>“What fate could be more cruel than mine?” sobbed
Berry wildly.</p>

<p>The old Indian wagged her turbaned head, muttering
low:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>“Death is the most cruel fate of all when it overtakes
the young, the beautiful, the loving. It is death
that menaces you, girl&mdash;death in a horrible form by
drowning!”</p>

<p>“Why should I tremble at death? I have nothing but
toil and sorrow in my life,” cried Berry wearily, with
the tears running down her face.</p>

<p>Again the woman peered into her hand, replying:</p>

<p>“The doom is not a certainty, only a risk. It may be
averted, and if you escape it, there will come a wondrous
change in your life. There will be years of love
and happiness and wealth before you.”</p>

<p>“You are sure, quite sure?” the girl cried piteously.</p>

<p>“It is written, and nothing can alter it,” cried the
seeress, and Berry thought of some words she had read
in a book of Eastern verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">The moving finger writes; and having writ,
</div><div class="indent0">Moves on: nor all your piety, nor wit
</div><div class="indent0">Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,
</div><div class="indent0">Nor all your tears wash out a word of it.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>She knelt there sobbing piteously, as a beaten child,
and that cracked voice went on, and on:</p>

<p>“I can save your life, girl, and I will do it, because
you are so young and so fair that I pity you. If you
will meet me on the stroke of twelve down in the
Bonair grounds in the northern walk leading to the private<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
zoo, I will lend you for a week a charm against
drowning&mdash;for nothing, because I pity you so. When
the week is ended the danger will be past, and a long
and happy life lies before you. Is it worth the trouble?
Will you come?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;yes, I will come!” faltered Berry wildly; then
she fled from the hag’s presence, followed by a low, exultant
laugh, and in the hall she fainted with the horror
of all she had heard, believing that the woman must
indeed be gifted with supernatural powers.</p>

<p>Now that she was alone, it all rushed wildly over
her, <a id="Ref_81" href="#BRef_81">and she knew</a> that she must go to receive the mysterious
charm that could avert her impending doom of
death.</p>

<p>“I can go and be back again before the kind housekeeper
returns,” she thought, slipping out of the room
and stealing like a shadow along the dim corridors till
she reached a door that led out upon the beautiful
grounds into the calm, sweet night.</p>

<p>The beautiful California night, sweet and balmy, although
it was March&mdash;how like a dream of beauty lay
the grounds about Bonair, with their thick shrubberies
and fragrant flowers!</p>

<p>Yet Berry, unused to nocturnal wanderings alone,
would have been frightened only for the wild excitement
that dominated every other emotion.</p>

<p>The full moon rode queenly in the cloudless sky, and
shone like silver on the lovely scene&mdash;on tall groups
of statuary, gleaming whitely against clumps of tropical
shrubbery, on arbors twined with roses, on tinkling
fountains, on tall, white clumps of lilies and beds of
hyacinths, scenting the air with sweetness. All that
wealth and taste could devise in this land so favored
by nature, was here in lavish measure adorning the
many acres of ground that surrounded the picturesque
pile of magnificent buildings called Bonair.</p>

<p>And simple Berenice Vining, to whom all this was
so new and amazing, caught her breath with a gasp,
remembering that Charley Bonair was heir to it all&mdash;the
only son of the proud multimillionaire.</p>

<p>She felt for the first time the vast difference between<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
her and the man who had made careless love to her for
twenty-four hours&mdash;love that was not great enough
to bridge the gulf between the lowly cottage and the
lofty castle, so that she might walk across it to his
arms.</p>

<p>Her thoughts flew to the old home, to the humble cottage,
with the morning glories climbing all over it in
blue and white and roseate glory, and a yearning came
to her for her little room again, with its cheap white
ruffled curtains at the window, and the simple adornings
so dear to a young girl’s heart.</p>

<p>Her heart rose in her throat, and she had to pause
and lean her head against a tree, while she sobbed in
hysterical distress:</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, mamma!”</p>

<p>Remorse throbbed at her bosom’s core. She had
done wrong to forsake the dear old mother whose heart
had been broken by her desertion.</p>

<p>“Alas, why was I not there to pray for her forgiveness?
She was all I had to love me on earth!
Those older brothers and sisters, they never cared for
Berry. They always scolded and berated me because I
was mamma’s pet; they said I was a spoiled child.
None of them will ever care to see me again!”</p>

<p>She sobbed on brokenly, without noticing that the
clock in the high tower had solemnly tolled out the<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
midnight hour, when she was to meet the fortune
teller and receive the charm that was to ward off her
impending cruel doom.</p>

<p>She did not even notice, in her perturbation, the delicate
odor of a fine cigar blending with the scent of the
flowers close by, and she would have darted away in
alarm had she dreamed that a young man was sitting
on a rustic seat in a clump of shrubbery just back of
her&mdash;so close indeed that she might have caught the
sound of his quick breathing only that it was drowned
by the tinkle of the fountain that, throwing its spray
high in the air, fell back again like the low patter of
rain upon the broad leaves of the lily-bordered pool.</p>

<p>But as for him, he had caught every word she
uttered, and he knew every tone of the sweet voice, too,
though he could not see her face as she clung there with
her cheek against the rough bark of the tree.</p>

<p>It was Charley Bonair, sick at heart and troubled,
who had hidden himself there in the solitude of the
beautiful night to puzzle over the problem of his
destiny.</p>

<p>He thought he had worked it all out before in the
moonlight nights on the yacht, before he had landed
from it at San Francisco. But that was when he had
believed that Berenice Vining was surely dead, and
that nothing remained but his duty to Rosalind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>Now it all rose again like a ghost that would not
down&mdash;the struggle between his heart and his duty,
for they did not agree.</p>

<p>His troth plight held him to Rosalind, his love belonged
to Berry.</p>

<p>But the pure little cottage maiden would not accept
the heart without the hand.</p>

<p>Now that he knew she still lived, his heart was in
a tumult between love and pride and duty.</p>

<p>He did not wish to make a mésalliance. His pride
clung to Rosalind, the heiress, and he felt he owed her
all respect and duty.</p>

<p>But his code of morals was so lax that if he could
have possessed Berry without a wedding ring, he would
have been loyal to her, even while wedding her rival,
and found a measure of happiness in the double life.</p>

<p>But so certain was he of the little maiden’s stainless
purity, that he knew it would be useless to reveal himself
to her, although sobbing there in touch of his
hand.</p>

<p>At the first sign of his presence he knew that she
would fly from him in alarm and consternation.</p>

<p>He had come home determined to be good, and delight
all his relatives by asking Rosalind to name the
wedding day. He had decided that since Berry must
surely be dead he could jog along quite comfortably<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
with the blond beauty. Since neither one professed
to be greatly in love, there would be plenty of ways
for such rich people to keep out of each other’s way.</p>

<p>All at once now he went back to his old resolve.</p>

<p>“I must marry Rosalind and be done with it. There
would be no end of a bother with my folks, and probably
disinheritance, if I cut the whole thing and married
little Berry. Besides, Rose is a good girl, after
all, and it would be a shame to break her heart.”</p>

<p>Just as he came to this eminently virtuous resolution,
and was softly rising to sneak away from the
temptation of folding the sobbing Berry to his heart,
there came an unlooked-for incident.</p>

<p>The sound of muffled footsteps suddenly paused by
the tree, and a hoarse voice muttered impatiently:</p>

<p>“Why did you fail to keep the tryst, girl? It is
long since the midnight bell tolled, and I grew weary
of waiting.”</p>

<p>Berry gave such a convulsive start backward that
the blossoming shrubs behind her were shaken, and
dropped a shower of sweet flower petals to the ground.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, I was so wretched thinking of my dear
mother dead and my lost home, and the sorrows of my
life, that I forgot everything else,” faltered the poor
girl, with a dazed air. “What was it, please, you
wanted of me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>Charley Bonair was not going to leave just now, oh,
no! He would stay and see what lark the girl was up
to, anyway. Perhaps time had changed her, and she
was not the good little angel of the past! Somehow
he felt himself grow jealous at the thought, even while
the quick thought came she might now be more to him.</p>

<p>Why did he feel all at once that he hated little
Berry? Was it that she had destroyed his faith?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">I deemed her the one thing undefiled
</div><div class="indent1">By the air we breathe, in a world of sin;
</div><div class="indent0">The truest, the tenderest, purest child,
</div><div class="indent1">A man ever trusted in.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>What was this reproach for a tryst she had failed to
keep? He would listen, he would learn her sin.</p>

<p>He leaned forward on his tiptoes, and got a good
peep through the rose branches at Berry and her interlocutor.
The latter looked like an old Indian squaw,
picturesque draped in an old red blanket, with a
feathered headdress over her seamy, swarthy face.</p>

<p>“Ah, a woman!” the young fellow thought to himself
in keen relief, that made his heart throb tumultuously.</p>

<p>He heard the coarse, guttural voice replying cajolingly:</p>

<p>“Have you forgot so soon, girl, the charm I promised
when I told your fortune, that was to avert a threatening
doom, and bring to you wealth and happiness?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>Berry gave a little cry of remembrance and pleading:</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember it all now. Forgive me that I
forgot. Oh, I was so sad, so sorrowful, I could think
of nothing but the tale you told me of the death of my
old mother. Oh, is it really, really true?”</p>

<p>The agony of those upraised eyes was enough to
pierce a heart of stone, but the old crone answered
malevolently:</p>

<p>“It is true as that the moon and stars shine in the
heavens to-night. She thought that you had fled with a
rich young man, who meant to ruin you, and she
cursed you for your sin and her disgrace.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am innocent and pure as the day I was
born! I pray Heaven that in death she knows the
truth!” moaned the poor girl wildly.</p>

<p>“We have no time for all this rant! It is time for
honest folks to be in their beds!” rejoined the Indian
impatiently. Charley Bonair started, asking himself:</p>

<p>“Now, where have I heard that voice before, and
that old saw in the same tone? It is strangely familiar,
somehow, with a difference that baffles one!”</p>

<p>He heard Berry murmur again sobbingly:</p>

<p>“Forgive me, I did not mean any harm. Have you
brought the charm with you?”</p>

<p>Then indeed Charley Bonair could scarcely keep
from betraying himself by laughing outright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[89]</span></p>

<p>“I left it around the path there in my bundle. Come
with me and you shall have it.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” Berry answered, simply and sweetly,
and moved away by her side, a slim, white, girlish figure
by the tall, grotesque figure of the other.</p>

<p>Bonair started to follow, then drew quickly back.</p>

<p>“It is none of my business to go spying on the dear,
silly little girl,” he decided. “She must be in love with
some other fellow now, by her anxiety over the old fortune
teller, who knows no more of her future than the
man in the moon. I’d better go back to the house and
announce myself, and done with it! Hello, I’ll finish
my cigar and drop around to my zoo, and see Zilla
first. They wrote me she had two cubs and was savage
as a lioness!”</p>

<p>He sauntered along in the moonlight when the cigar
was lighted; but suddenly his repose was shaken by a
terrible sound&mdash;loud, piercing shrieks coming from the
direction of the zoo.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">STRANGE MYSTERIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“The shrieks are coming from the bear pit! What
if some one had fallen in there!” cried Bonair, turning
suddenly cold as ice with apprehension, and starting
at a wild run in the direction of the sounds.</p>

<p>As the housekeeper had told Berry, her young master
had been fond of animal pets from boyhood, and had
quite a choice collection of his own at the southern
end of the park, where they were taken care of by a
man and his wife.</p>

<p>In this miniature zoo there was an aviary, some
prairie dogs, a monkey house, and some larger animals,
including bears of different species. Zilla, the black
bear, was his favorite. He had got her himself several
years ago while deer hunting in the mountains of
West Virginia. A handsome fawn, a black bear cub,
and some smaller animals, were the trophies he carried
home, and he had duly christened the cub Zilla, and
petted her so much that she loved him with a doglike
devotion. In his last letter from his sister Marie, she
had told him that Zilla was now the proud parent of
twins, and had become fierce as a lioness in defense
of her young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>He had just started for the bear pit, idly wondering
if Zilla would know him again after his absence of almost
a year, when those frenzied shrieks of some one
in deadly peril made him fly to the rescue in breathless
haste, his heart sinking with a terrible dread.</p>

<p>Suppose it were little Berry herself that had unwittingly
stumbled and fallen into the bear pit?</p>

<p>Oh, horrors! One blow of Zilla’s big paw would
be sufficient to kill the lovely brown-eyed maid. In
the twinkling of an eye, she would be dead!</p>

<p>There was one chance in a hundred for her life.</p>

<p>If he could get there before the fatal blow was given,
if he could spring down into the pit, and arrest Zilla’s
furious onslaught by the sound of his voice&mdash;the voice
of the beloved master!</p>

<p>But would she remember him still? Would she
yield obedience to his command in her new character
of motherhood, filled with the instinct of protection to
her young? If she would not, then woe unto any poor
wretch who had fallen into her angry clutches!</p>

<p>With these thoughts in his mind he flew toward the
zoo, with a wild prayer in his heart to be in time, just
in time!</p>

<p>Every moment was an eternity, and his feet seemed
to drag beneath him. He had never realized the value
of a moment of time before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>But now life itself seemed to hang upon his haste.</p>

<p>Fortunately the distance was short, so that he covered
it in a space of time less than five minutes&mdash;five
minutes that might have been fatal, alas, for ere now
the wild shrieks had died into silence more terrifying
still&mdash;portentous silence in which the victim might
have died.</p>

<p>At last! At last! After an eternity of time it
seemed to him&mdash;he reached the scene of his suspicions.</p>

<p>He was right, for from the pit came terrible sounds,
while all the varied denizens of the zoo, having been
startled from sleep by the screams of fear, were making
hideous din in their several voices, the uproar creating
a sort of babel of the scene.</p>

<p>Over all shone the full moon in a cloudless sky, making
everything almost as clear as day.</p>

<p>Bonair flung himself face downward, peering into
Zilla’s abode.</p>

<p>Down there was something white that could dimly
be seen on the ground, while Zilla crouched over it,
hitting pounding blows with her big paws. The other
three bears who shared the pit were not taking any
part, only walking about on their hind legs, expressing
dismay and wonder by dismal and prolonged growling.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven, have pity!” Bonair cried wildly, and
leaped into the pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>He fell flat on his face, and Zilla’s attention was
quickly attracted so that the lifted paw, big, hairy,
ponderous, fell nerveless as she turned desperately on
the new intruder upon her domain.</p>

<p>Before he could struggle up to his feet, breathless
from his race and the shock of his fall, the black bear
dealt him a blow hard enough to knock the life out of
him if he had not been nerved by a terrible anxiety that
almost made him proof against her force. He got up
feebly and clutched at her, muttering through a mouthful
of blood:</p>

<p>“Zilla! Zilla!”</p>

<p>The name proved his salvation, for the huge black
animal was opening her arms to crush him to her in a
grip that meant death, but she paused in sudden indecision.</p>

<p>“Zilla! Zilla!” the man cried again hoarsely, entreatingly,
his heart leaping to his throat in panting
gasps.</p>

<p>A stifled moan smote his ear, but it did not come
from Zilla, but from the still white something on the
ground, and at the sound the bear turned toward it
again with a ferocious growl.</p>

<p>But the great uplifted hairy paw did not fall, for
with lightning swiftness, Bonair sprang forward, his<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
fist shot out with terrible force and struck the animal
just between the eyes, so that she lurched backward.</p>

<p>“Zilla, you devil, if you have hurt her, I will kill
you!” he shouted, as he flung himself between them.</p>

<p>Madam Bruin, who had seen stars for a moment as
his fist struck her face, now regained her feet, standing
erect and menacing, but without making direct
attack. She seemed dazed, stupefied, and a sort of
shiver shook her huge black body.</p>

<p>As the moon shone down on the strange scene, she
got her first look at the intruder, and she began to
tremble more and more with the rush of instinctive
memory. Bonair saw already that the battle was won.</p>

<p>“Oh, Zilla, you know me at last,” he cried, in blended
relief and exultation, and added:</p>

<p>“Down, down, wretched beast, at my feet!”</p>

<p>Oh, wondrous change.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that the maddened, murderous,
plunging beast of a moment ago could be transformed
like this into a tender, loving animal that
groveled on the ground and licked the master’s hand
with a quivering red tongue like a dog’s. But the
transformation was wrought.</p>

<p>There she lay prostrate at Bonair’s command, conquered,
humble, loving, her huge black body quivering
all over, her whole attitude one of complete submission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>“Lie still, now,” her master commanded, roughly
stroking her head, even while he turned in an agony of
anxiety to that figure huddled on the ground the other
side of him. He stooped down to examine it, and as he
did so Zilla’s fury returned. She growled and half
rose, but his restraining hand thrust her fiercely back.</p>

<p>“Must I slay you, beast?” he demanded, with a blow
that forced her to be quiescent, while he made a further
examination of the white something that after one
moan had given no further sign of life.</p>

<p>Alas, his fearful heart had told him right.</p>

<p>It was she, Berenice Vining, the little maid who had
stirred his heart to love’s joy and pain as no other
woman had ever done before! Little Berry of the
starry eyes and pure heart.</p>

<p>Gowned in simple white and seemingly lifeless, she
lay, and he turned to find some implement to slay
Zilla, in the rush of furious vengeance.</p>

<p>But the bear had slunk from him to the corner where
her darlings whined in their soft nest, and he tripped
and fell in his agitation&mdash;not in a pool of blood, but
upon a soft mass of wool&mdash;the thick red blanket he had
seen on the Indian fortune teller when she had come to
drag Berry away to this hideous doom.</p>

<p>He comprehended that the woman had thrust Berry
down to this awful death, and that in the life-and-death<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
struggle, she had dragged down with her the scarlet
blanket.</p>

<p>But why, why, why, had the old hag thirsted for this
beautiful, innocent young life? was the question that
struck him like a blow in the face.</p>

<p>He knelt down by her in anguish; he put his hand beneath
her face and turned it to the light.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was no mark or bruise upon it to
mar its lifeless beauty, but the lids lay heavy and dark
on the white cheek, and the heart, when he laid his hand
over it, had no pulsation. He had come too late.
Zilla’s blows had battered out the life from the beautiful
body!</p>

<p>Charley Bonair groaned in anguish.</p>

<p>“Dead! Dead! Poor little darling; sweet, pure
child! How could so slight a form survive those thudding
blows I heard as I dropped into the pit? They
shall die for this, the old hag who flung her down to
her fate, and the murderous Zilla, who finished her
work! Now there is nothing left but to take her out of
this accursed hole back to my home, my last dead love,
my little Berry, whom fate placed beyond my reach.
Ah,” the tone changed to one of horror, as a bullet
whizzed suddenly down into the pit past his cheek
and buried itself in his shoulder.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A TIMELY RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>How closely joy and sorrow tread on each other’s
heels, how nearly they touch each other!</p>

<p>Up at the splendid Bonair palace the music and dancing
went on apace, Lucile and Marie being all in ignorance
of their brother’s proximity and peril.</p>

<p>His presence in the theater had been unobserved,
and none dreamed of his return.</p>

<p>The splendid fête went on, and the music of the
orchestra and the sounds of flying feet drowned the
shrieks of mortal peril that arose from the bear pit.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Charley Bonair and Berenice Vining,
both victims of some mysterious enemy, must perish
for want of a helping hand in this hour of terrible
danger.</p>

<p>It must have ended thus in speedy death, had not
the tumult of the bear pit been overheard at the small
cottage near by, where the zoo keeper and his wife
made their home.</p>

<p>The woman, a lighter sleeper than the man, had been
half aroused by the sound of Berenice’s piercing
shrieks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>She raised her head from the pillow and listened
intently for a moment, and cold chills of terror ran
down her spine at the agony of those fearful cries,
as of one in mortal peril.</p>

<p>“Oh, surely there’s murder being done somewhere
very close,” she groaned aloud, and now thoroughly
aroused, proceeded to shake her husband awake.</p>

<p>“Wake up, wake up, Sam Cline; don’t lay there
snoring like a pig, when somebody’s getting killed,
sure! Wake, wake, wake!” she exclaimed, and to
expedite the awakening, she sprinkled his face with
cold water, which soon had the desired effect.</p>

<p>“What’s broke loose Mandy, hey?” he exclaimed,
in bewilderment, and she answered:</p>

<p>“Sam, there’s been the most terrible screams coming
up about the zoo, and now I can hear everything there
roused up and making the most fearful din&mdash;enough
to split your ears open. Listen, don’t you hear it yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’d be stone-deaf sure if I didn’t hear all that
racket! Suthin’ dreadful must ’a’ happened, sure! I’d
better dress and go up and see!” he answered, hurrying
into his clothing.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” declared Mandy, throwing on
a wrapper, and thrusting her bare feet into slippers,
without more ado, they rushed in the direction of the<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
zoo, getting near enough when the shot was fired down
into the bear pit to see a tall, white figure running
away in breathless haste.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s trying to kill the bears, sure! I wonder
what for, now!” gasped Mandy, almost breathless with
her speed.</p>

<p>“Run! run! let’s catch her, the wretch!” panted Sam
Cline, but the white figure, having the advance of
them, seemed to fly like the wind, and quickly disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile as they rushed on, amid the babel of
varied animal sounds, they came to the bear pit, and
their further pursuit of the criminal was arrested by
hearing a human groan, mingled with the hoarse,
frightened growls of the brutes below.</p>

<p>How it all ended, Sam Cline related in his own
words somewhat later, when he carried the news up to
Bonair, calling Mrs. Fortescue out for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Land sakes, ma’am, a terrible thing has happened
down to the bear pit,” he began excitedly. “Mandy
and me was woke up by awful screams from down to
the zoo, and then all the birds and beasts got scared,
and sech a racket was never heard before, I reckon!&mdash;leastwise
in the hour of midnight, when everything
is s’posed to be still and asleep. Well, wife and I
rushed out as fast as we could to the scene, and next<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
thing, zip&mdash;bang! went off a pistol right in front of
Zilla’s pit, and we saw a woman all in white running
away like mad! We gave chase, but she had the start
of us too far, and disappeared in the shrubbery jest as
we got to the pit, and heard a terrible groaning that
made us stop to investigate.” He paused for breath
in his rapid narration, and the handsome old woman
shuddered with prescient dread.</p>

<p>“Go on, go on!”</p>

<p>Sam Cline cleared his throat, and continued:</p>

<p>“We peered down into the bear pit&mdash;and, oh, what
a sight was there, ma’am! All the bears in an uproar
with fright and excitement, and in the midst of it all
two people, a man and a woman, as we could see by
her white dress. Well, we called to the bears, and they
quieted down, knowing our voices so well, and then, I
swear to gracious! I nearly jumped out of my skin
with surprise, for a voice called out to me that I know
as well as I know my own, and said, with a groan:</p>

<p>“‘Sam Cline, for Heaven’s sake, open the door and
let us out of this den.’”</p>

<p>“A voice you knew?” repeated Mrs. Fortescue questioningly,
but the man hurried on, in a voice broken
by excitement:</p>

<p>“You may be sure that Mandy and I obeyed him fast
enough, ma’am, and found out when we got in the pit<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
that the man had been shot in the shoulder, and that the
woman with him was apparently dead.”</p>

<p>“This is terrible!” shuddered Mrs. Fortescue.</p>

<p>“I should say so, indeed, ma’am,” answered Sam
Cline, continuing. “The man told me he heard screams
from the pit, and running to it, saw the woman being
beaten to death by Zilla. He jumped down to her
rescue, but just as he got the bear subdued, somebody
fired down at him, and the ball went through his shoulder.
He sank down with the pain, and grew weak with
the blood spurting from the wound, just as we discovered
him. Well, to make my story short, I tore off
my shirt and bandaged his wound, Mandy fighting off
the bears that went wild at smelling the blood. Then I
took the dead woman in my arms, and Mandy led the
half-swooning man, and so we got them to my cottage,
and I telephoned for a doctor as soon as I could, and
next thing, I posted up here to break the news to you
and the young ladies about their brother.”</p>

<p>“Their brother!” exclaimed the old lady wonderingly,
and he answered quickly:</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, their own brother, Mr. Charley Bonair,
shot through the shoulder, and so upset by all he
went through in the pit, that as soon as we got him in
my house he fell down by the couch, where I laid the
dead woman, and swooned with excitement, so I just<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
left Mandy to revive him while I telephoned the doctor
to come, and posted off up here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fortescue, pale and trembling, cried faintly:</p>

<p>“Are you sure you have not made a mistake, Sam
Cline? My nephew is not even in San Francisco!”</p>

<p>“He landed from the yacht early yesterday evening,
ma’am&mdash;he told me so&mdash;but he had not spoken to his
sisters yet. He was in the grounds, coming home, I
suppose, when he heard the shrieks from the pit, and
ran to the lady’s assistance,” explained Sam Cline
quickly.</p>

<p>“And the lady? Did you know her, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Not her name, ma’am, but her face. She was that
pretty little actress that played in the theater here last
night. I knew her again as soon as I clapped eyes on
her face, but I don’t know as I ever heard her name.”</p>

<p>“This is wonderful, mysterious!” cried the lady.
“Oh, what shall I do? It seems too bad to break up
the ball with this shocking news, but there seems
nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>Sam Cline hesitated, then said humbly:</p>

<p>“If I might make so bold as to advise you, ma’am,
I’d say let the ball go on, because it won’t last much
longer, anyway, I guess, and see Mr. Bonair yourself
before you alarm his sisters.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right, Sam; I hate to stir up a<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
panic in the ballroom if I can avoid it. Wait outside
for me till I get a wrap, and I will go with you to the
cottage and see Charley.”</p>

<p>If she had cherished the least doubt of it being her
nephew, she soon had proof of it on reaching the
keeper’s cottage, for Mrs. Cline had succeeded in reviving
the patient, and he lay pale and nervous on a
narrow cot in the same room where they had placed the
seemingly dead actress upon a neat white bed.</p>

<p>“Charley, dear, this is terrible!” the lady cried, sinking
down on her knees and kissing his pallid brow,
damp with the dew of pain.</p>

<p>He took the kiss impatiently, crying fervently:</p>

<p>“Aunt Florence, do not think about me! I’m all
right, sure!&mdash;see about that poor girl over there, please!
Is she really dead, or only in a very deep swoon? By
Heaven, if Zilla has killed her, I’ll put the brute to
torture, I’ll burn her at the stake!”</p>

<p>He ended with a groan of commingled fury and
stifled pain, and just then there came a loud rap upon
the door. The physician had fortunately arrived.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BITTER RIVALRY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>He had his hands full certainly, with his two patients,
for Charley Bonair insisted that he should examine
the young lady first to see if there were the least
hope of her recovery from the swoon or unconsciousness
that seemed to them all so terribly like death
itself.</p>

<p>When Madam Fortescue returned from the cottage
two hours later, the grand ball was ending&mdash;the “dear
five hundred friends” tearing themselves away.</p>

<p>With commendable self-possession she received their
adieus, and waited till her weary nieces had got into
their dressing gowns before she called them together
and imparted her important news.</p>

<p>Lucile and Marie were sadly frightened, and tears
flowed fast from their beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>“Poor, dear brother, we must go to him at once,”
they cried, but Madam Fortescue forbade it.</p>

<p>“No, the physician wished him to rest quietly to-night
in the care of Sam Cline, but you both will be
allowed to see him to-morrow. The wound is not
necessarily dangerous, but it is better for him to remain<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
a day or two at the cottage before he comes
home.”</p>

<p>“And the pretty little actress&mdash;Miss Vane. Do you
say that she revived?” cried Marie.</p>

<p>“She has shown signs of life, that is all. The poor
young girl’s body is a mass of bruises. He did not find
any broken bones, however, and says she owes her escape
from that to the thick red blanket of the murderous
old squaw that fell down on her, and formed
with its folds a cushion against the fury of Zilla’s
blows.”</p>

<p>The two young girls shuddered with horror over
the story. They recalled the bright beauty of the
sparkling young actress with keen admiration, and realized
the difference now with heartfelt sorrow.</p>

<p>“She must have a good nurse and every possible attention
to restore her life. We will charge ourselves
with all the expenses, poor girl,” they exclaimed.</p>

<p>And then they fell to wondering about the criminal.
Who was she&mdash;how had she happened to be at Bonair?</p>

<p>The young girls declared solemnly that they had
not employed any fortune teller, had not known of
her presence in the house. It was a decided mystery.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the housekeeper may know something
about it,” suggested the aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hopson was summoned and cleared up the
little mystery.</p>

<p>She told how Miss Montague had called her out
while the banquet was in progress, saying that an old
Indian fortune teller had called and offered her services
to aid in the evening’s entertainment.</p>

<p>Miss Montague was so pleased with the idea that she
had engaged the old woman at her own expense to remain
two hours and amuse the theatrical company
after the banquet. She had asked Mrs. Hopson to
prepare the little alcove for the seeress, and to apprise
the members of the company of the treat in store for
them. Mrs. Hopson had consented to the plan, and
Rosalind had left her, after cautioning the housekeeper
to say nothing to her mistresses of the little
plot, saying she wished to defray all the cost herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopson went on and told of the fright the
young actress had received on hearing the story of her
future from the old seeress, and of how she had taken
her to her own apartments to spend the night, but returned
to find her missing.</p>

<p>“It irked me to find her gone, but I never thought of
danger to the sweet, pretty young girl,” she declared,
adding:</p>

<p>“Now it seems to me that there was some deep-laid
plot to injure the young actress. That old Indian<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
woman was very likely a disguised enemy that sought
her life. Failing to frighten the girl to death with her
terrible prophecies, she got her out of the house some
way and pushed her into the pit to meet her death
from the angry black bear. When she saw that rescue
was likely, she made one last desperate attempt at murder
by shooting down among the bears. Oh, the
vile wretch, she should be torn limb from limb! No
punishment is too great for such a fiend!”</p>

<p>“Yet, I doubt if she will ever be apprehended. She
has had ample time to escape and cover up all traces of
her identity,” sighed Madam Fortescue, wishing from
her heart that the wretch might be brought to justice.</p>

<p>“Oh, how grieved, how dismayed Rosalind will be to
hear all this,” cried Lucile, with tears. “Only think,
when she was generously planning such a pleasure for
those people out of her own purse, she was vilely imposed
on by a murderous wretch who nearly destroyed
two lives. Why, if dear Charley should die, dear Rosalind
would feel like a murderess, although she did not
even know that he was in the city.”</p>

<p>“But where was Rosalind all the evening? It seems
to me now that I do not remember seeing her at all in
the ballroom,” exclaimed Madam Fortescue.</p>

<p>“Why, poor Rosie had a little chapter of accidents
that spoiled her whole evening,” answered Marie. “In<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
the first place, she became suddenly ill, soon after the
dancing began, and had to retire to her room to lie
down a while. It was one of those terrible headaches,
you know, that will only get better in a dark, quiet
place, so she said we must leave her alone, as she should
lock her door and must not be disturbed. Well, something
after midnight she returned to the ballroom, and
was better, but looking so pale and ill yet that I was
surprised to see her dancing again. But pretty soon
she came to me all angry and nervous, and I could not
blame her at all. Some one had torn a great rent in
her white lace gown, and she had to retire, and she
said she would not appear again, because she was too
tired to change her gown. Poor thing, I hope she will
sleep off her sickness by to-morrow, so that she can
go with us to see Charley.”</p>

<p>“It will give her a terrible turn to hear of all the
mischief that old fortune teller did, but it cannot be
helped now,” remarked Mrs. Hopson.</p>

<p>Then they all separated for the night, or rather
morning, since it lacked but a few short hours to daylight.</p>

<p>As Miss Montague was the latest of all arising, and
took her coffee in her own room, it was very late afternoon
before the two sisters came in and told her their
startling news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>She was quite as much dismayed as they expected,
and when she heard that it was her betrothed, Charley
Bonair himself, who had been wounded in the pit,
Rosalind fainted away in dead earnest. When she
revived she was almost hysterical.</p>

<p>“Do not tell me he is dead, my love, my Charley,
or my heart will break!” she moaned in anguish.</p>

<p>When they told her he would get well, that they
had been down to the cottage already to see him, and
that he was resting easily, she smiled again.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad, so happy, that he is spared
to us! But, dear girls, will you not bring him home
now, at once? I wish to see him so much! Did he
ask for me? Did he send me any message?”</p>

<p>The sisters were so sorry for her that they hated
to tell her the truth, that Charley had not even called
her name.</p>

<p>But after confessing it they hastened to make excuses
for their brother, saying he was so ill and feverish
it was no wonder he had temporarily forgotten
everything but his own sufferings.</p>

<p>Rosalind accepted their explanation with outward
complacence, but the hot fires of jealousy seethed madly
in her heart.</p>

<p>To herself she said bitterly:</p>

<p>“He did not ask for me, because he does not care,<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
he thinks only of her, the little witch who stole his
fickle heart from me! How strange, how very strange,
that he should have been on the spot to save her life!
He must have known she would be here, and followed
to bask in the light of her eyes. Oh, how I hate
her! Why does she not die, why should she live to
balk me of my happiness, for the whole world is too
narrow for my rival and me!”</p>

<p>In her angry thoughts she almost forgot the presence
of the sisters, and they were startled by the lowering
frown upon her face, realizing that she was
bitterly disappointed at getting no message from
Charley.</p>

<p>They hastened to tell her that the physician would
not permit him to leave his bed yet, but that they would
accompany her at any time to see her lover, assuring
her that he would be charmed with the visit.</p>

<p>Rosalind believed quite otherwise, but she kept back
the bitter words between her lips, resolving to go, indeed,
to visit him, and to hurry up their marriage if
she could, before the pretty actress got well.</p>

<p>Of the poor girl hovering between life and death,
and all unconscious of her surroundings, she said not
a word in pity, and when she was asked about the Indian
seeress who had wrought such woe, she declared<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
that she had never seen her before that night, and
knew nothing of her whereabouts.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope none of you will blame me for what
she did!” Rosalind cried artlessly. “I am not to blame,
for I only thought to give pleasure. The woman came
to me as I leaned out of a window, and proffered her
wish, and I immediately granted it. How was I to
know that at heart she was a fiend?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FRIEND IN NEED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Rosalind’s sorrow, so prettily acted, had its due effect.
Her friends quickly acquitted her of all blame,
and hastened to soothe her ruffled feelings by praising
the good intentions that had prompted her terrible mistake.</p>

<p>The Bonairs hated anything like notoriety, and
they tried very hard to keep the sensational events of
that night out of the newspapers.</p>

<p>But their efforts failed of success, and the reporters
reaped a rich harvest.</p>

<p>When the manager of Berry’s company came the
next day to inquire for his missing star, he was astounded
to learn through the voluble housekeeper of
the tragedy of the previous night.</p>

<p>He went quite white, and trembled with the shock,
and as he was rather young and very handsome, Mrs.
Hopson surmised that he must be the young girl’s lover,
and pitied him very much.</p>

<p>He cried out hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Barely alive, you say, with but one chance in a
hundred for her life? Oh, how terrible! I can scarcely
credit it, unless I see her with my own eyes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>He went from the mansion to the cottage, and Mrs.
Cline permitted him to see the poor, unconscious girl
upon the bed, breathing so faintly that it seemed as
if every pulsation must be her last.</p>

<p>“Dying, poor girl, dying! And I loved her, oh, I
loved her better than my life!” the man cried, sinking
on his knees by the bed, and pressing his lips to the
cold little hand that lay outside the cover.</p>

<p>“Then you were going to marry the poor young
lady?” asked Mrs. Cline.</p>

<p>“No, for she had rejected my suit, telling me she
had loved once and her faith had been destroyed
forever. She was very unhappy, I know, over her
broken lovedream, but I still hoped on, believing that in
time she might forget her false lover and turn to me.
In all our leading parts I was cast as her lover, and I
threw my whole soul into everything, hoping to win her
at last. Alas! all is over, and her sweet life has fallen
beneath the machinations of a cowardly enemy,” the
man moaned, staggering up to his feet, with a look of
despair that touched the woman’s heart.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry for you, sir,” she murmured, putting
the corner of her white apron to her eyes, that were wet
with tears.</p>

<p>He thanked her with a look, and added:</p>

<p>“While she lives, Mrs. Cline, see that she receives<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
the best of attention, and look to me to settle all expenses
to&mdash;the last!” his voice breaking over the word.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, the Bonairs have already pledged themselves
to pay everything. A trained nurse is coming
within the hour, and the physician will be in frequently,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“May I see Mr. Bonair? Will you take my card to
him?” asked the manager.</p>

<p>She assented, and he was kept waiting some time,
while she related to Charley Bonair every word he
had uttered, faithfully describing the emotion he had
displayed.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair was lying on his couch very pale
and restless, and he grew almost ghastly as the tale
ran on.</p>

<p>“That will do, you may bring him in,” he said, at
last.</p>

<p>The next moment:</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Bonair, will you pardon this intrusion?”</p>

<p>“You are welcome, Mr. Weston. Pray be seated,”
Charley answered quietly, gazing hard at his handsome
rival.</p>

<p>Truly he was handsome and manly, with that dark,
flashing eye that so easily wins its way to a woman’s
heart. Charley Bonair wondered jealously that Berry
had been able to withstand its fascination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>“Dear little one, surely she loved me well,” he
thought, with a twinge of the bitterest remorse and
pain.</p>

<p>The manager had somewhat recovered his self-possession
that had wavered in the presence of his dying
love. He did not give way as before Mrs. Cline, but
conversed easily and with a sorrowful dignity that
impressed the hearer, against his wishes, with profound
respect.</p>

<p>“A dangerous rival, and perhaps more worthy of her
than I am,” Bonair said to himself, with a sweeping
self-contempt new and withering.</p>

<p>If she lived, poor little Berry, who could tell but that
such devotion might win her at last?&mdash;but he groaned
aloud at the thought.</p>

<p>“Your pardon. A twinge of pain in that confounded
shoulder,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Permit me to praise your acting last night,” he
added. “It was superb, and, in fact, your company is
an admirable one.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, but we are almost ruined now by this
terrible happening. No woman in my company is capable
of taking the leading part at short notice. I
shall arrange to pay the company a week’s salary in
advance, and disband for an indefinite time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>“You must permit me to assist in the financial part;
I feel it my duty, and will make it my pleasure. I cannot
forget that the disaster came to you through your
appearance at my home last night,” the wounded man
said cordially.</p>

<p>But the manager declined the offer with a proud,
though gentle, dignity, winning more and more Bonair’s
respect.</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir, but I must decline your offer,
since I am amply able to meet these expenses,” he
said, adding after a moment’s hesitation:</p>

<p>“Whatever you may choose to spend in tracing Miss
Vane’s cowardly murderer will be well spent.”</p>

<p>“No expense will be spared for that,” Bonair promised,
growing so pale again that the visitor felt he
was staying too long, and took a courteous and sympathetic
leave.</p>

<p>It was a nine days’ wonder in the papers, and the reporters
“worked the story for all it was worth.” Meanwhile
the Weston Company became so interesting to the
general public that the next cleverest actress studied
Berry’s part, and the new play, “A Wayside Flower,”
ran successfully for weeks upon the boards of a popular
theater.</p>

<p>All this time Berry was lingering between life and<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
death from the terrible pounding Zilla had given her
in the bear pit, but at last the wavering balance began
to incline toward life, gladdening many anxious hearts,
but filling one, alas, with malignant hate.</p>

<p>For Rosalind’s jealous hatred waxed hotter every
day, and could she have found a chance to be alone
in that sick room for five minutes, it is hard to say
what might have happened.</p>

<p>But a young princess could not have been guarded
with more loving care than the poor little actress, and
it was all through Charley Bonair that this was so.</p>

<p>He employed two competent nurses for the sick
room, and one or the other was ordered to remain always
in the girl’s apartment.</p>

<p>“We must remember always that she has a cruel
and unscrupulous enemy thirsting for her young life,”
he said. “That enemy may be hovering about, watching
for an opportunity to complete her murderous
work. She must be foiled in her terrible designs,” he
said firmly, and Rosalind, who heard the words, turned
aside to hide a cruel sneer that parted her crimson
lips.</p>

<p>She was disappointed in all her crafty little schemes
for entrapping him into marriage before Berry recovered.
It was plainer to her than ever that she had
lost every hold she had upon him, and she dreaded<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
every day that he would ask for a release from his
engagement.</p>

<p>Rosalind said to herself that when that happened she
was afraid she would go mad of her anger and despair.</p>

<p>A jilted bride! How could she bear the stigma, how
turn aside the jeers of her little carping world?</p>

<p>“I cannot, I will not release him if he dares plead
to me. I will hold him to his promise, and he dare
not back down!” she vowed bitterly.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair’s convalescence was so slow that
every one became uneasy, not dreaming that he played
a deceitful part in order to remain as long as he could
beneath the same roof with Berry. Besides, as he said
to himself, he could hold Rosalind off better that way.
Though she came every day with his sisters to visit
him, he frequently pretended to be too ill or nervous to
receive them till at last his doctor rallied him soundly.</p>

<p>“What game is it you are playing, Bonair? You
were well enough two weeks ago.”</p>

<p>Before Bonair left at last, the nurses permitted him
to sit a half hour in Berry’s room watching her as she
slept, with the dark silken lashes prone upon her snowy
cheek, and the breath just stirring the white folds
of her breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>The sight went to his heart, stirring it with profound
emotion, so that he said to himself:</p>

<p>“How can I dream of ever wedding any but this
beautiful creature, my soul’s true mate? She must be
mine alone; I must break with Rosalind!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE OLD LOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I must break with Rosalind! I can wed no other
than sweet little Berry, my soul’s true mate!” Bonair
cried passionately, again to his own heart, when he
was back in his palatial home, leaving Berry at the
lowly cottage of the zoo keeper.</p>

<p>All the puerile questions of wealth and position that
had held them apart became dross in his eyes, swept
away in the torrent of a love that would no longer
brook opposition to its restless force.</p>

<p>Perhaps jealousy of Berry’s handsome lover, young
Weston, added fuel to the fire of his love, but it began
to burn with a consuming flame that destroyed
everything in its path. A gifted poet has fitly portrayed
the state of his mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">When the court of the mind is ruled by reason,
</div><div class="indent1">I know it is wiser for us to part;

</div><div class="indent0">They whisper to me that the king is cruel,
</div><div class="indent1">That his reign is wicked, his law a sin,
</div><div class="indent0">And every word they utter is fuel
</div><div class="indent1">To the flame that smolders within.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>His dread of Rosalind’s grief and anger seemed
to vanish before the new force of his passion for<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
Berry, and he said to himself grimly that he must have
it out with Rosalind, and be done with it. It was best
to “be off with the old love” before he was “on with
the new.”</p>

<p>The opportunity came soon.</p>

<p>His sister Marie privately lectured him on his indifference
to his betrothed.</p>

<p>“How can you be so cruel to poor Rose? You treat
her like a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Has she complained of me?” he asked evasively.</p>

<p>“How can she help it? The dear girl is miserable
at heart, although she bears up bravely. You know
every one is caviling because the wedding day is not
set. Why don’t you settle it once for all, Charley,
dear?”</p>

<p>Her coaxing arms were round his neck, her bright
eyes beaming into his, and he sighed:</p>

<p>“Girls are always dead set on weddings! I don’t
see why! I think them great bores myself!”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you get yours over and be done
with it?” persisted the girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not in any hurry to lose my bachelor freedom,
sis; I fancy Rose would henpeck me dreadfully,”
yawning.</p>

<p>“She would not, I’m sure&mdash;that is if you behave
yourself, sir! Of course you would have to give up<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
some of your bad habits if you were a married man&mdash;flirting,
for instance&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;drinking! You are
a little too fond of the winecup, aren’t you, now?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;if you say so,” he replied nonchalantly, taking
his lecture coolly, and adding: “I wonder if
Rose is going to write out a list of musts and must nots
for me to sign on the wedding day; do you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! Go and ask her if you want to
know! She’s in the library now, half crying because
a girl asked her if her wedding would be soon, otherwise
she wanted her to make one of a house party at
her home this fall. Don’t you see how embarrassing
the uncertainty is, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. We must have an understanding about
it,” he replied, with a sudden gravity that emboldened
her to add:</p>

<p>“Only yesterday Rosalind refused a proposal that
was exceptional, in every way, and when she told me
of it she half sighed: ‘He’s very nice, and if I had
not been engaged to Charley, I might have said yes.’”</p>

<p>“It isn’t too late to call him back. I’ll tell her she
may do so!” he exclaimed eagerly.</p>

<p>Marie pinched his ear and laughed:</p>

<p>“Getting jealous, are you, old boy? Well, you see,
there are others who admire Rose beside yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” he replied, getting up carelessly, and
moving to the door.</p>

<p>“You’re going to Rosalind?” she asked hopefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will not delay speaking to her any longer,”
he replied, going out as he spoke, and getting a glass
of wine to steady himself, for he owned to himself
he was a little bit nervous, thinking uneasily.</p>

<p>“She’ll make no end of a scene, of course&mdash;maybe
call me a cur and all that. The sooner it’s over, the
better.”</p>

<p>Fortified with several glasses of wine, he wended
his way to the library.</p>

<p>Rosalind was there, sure enough, exquisitely gowned
in some soft green fabric, with loads of lace trimming,
that was very becoming to her blond type and
she reclined rather pensively in a large leather chair.</p>

<p>Charley throwing himself down carelessly into the
opposite chair, returned lightly:</p>

<p>“Very complimentary, I am sure, for I fancied you
were thinking of the other fellow.”</p>

<p>She wrinkled her brows at him.</p>

<p>“The other fellow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you know, Rosalind&mdash;the one who was so nice
you would have accepted his proposal if you hadn’t
been engaged to me.”</p>

<p>“So Marie told you that nonsense, Charley! Ha! ha!
Of course it was only a jest!” laughed Rosalind, looking
up at him with arch blue eyes, full of tenderness.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair did not return the fond glance, he
looked at her with serious gravity, unmoved by all her
coquettish beauty and rich attire. He answered
frankly:</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that it was a jest. I hoped it
was truth.”</p>

<p>“Charley!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I hoped it was true,” he reiterated gravely,
“because I came in here to tell you it was not too late
to call him back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Charley!” reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Honor bright,” he answered, still without smiling,
and adding nervously, “oh, Rosalind, can’t you see
that he would be a better match for you than I, because
he loves you, while I&mdash;I, in spite of myself, have
grown cold, careless, indifferent to you!”</p>

<p>“Cruel! Cruel!” sobbed the girl, behind her jeweled
fingers.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it, dear, but I cannot help it. I tried
to be true to you, but fate willed otherwise, and I’ve
struggled too long! I give it up for useless now. Despise
me if you will, I deserve it, I know, and I don’t
blame you. But, Rosalind, if you held me to my
promise I couldn’t make you happy. I should hate
you, instead of loving you. There, the bitter truth
is out! Will you set me free?”</p>

<p>“It might not be as easy for me as for you, Charley.
I am not so fickle-minded, perhaps, but I suppose I have
a right to ask you one question!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, go on,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is only this, Charley, dear: Has your heart
only wandered from me, or is there&mdash;some one else?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>His handsome face flushed a little under her sorrowful
glances, but he answered bravely:</p>

<p>“Forgive me for hurting you, Rosalind, but I will
not deceive. Yes, you have guessed the truth. There
is some one else!”</p>

<p>Rosalind sighed heavily:</p>

<p>“It is worse than I thought. Indifference might be
cured if I had no rival, but this is hopeless. Oh,
Charley, who is she, the girl who has won your love
from me? Her name?”</p>

<p>“Rosalind, I would rather not tell you yet.”</p>

<p>“That is unfair to me, Charley, very unfair!” bitterly.
“Surely I have a deep interest in my successful
rival. Does she love you?”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>“Then you have not asked her yet?”</p>

<p>“I waited for my release from you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, you will ask her now, at once! Is she
near at hand, Charley, or perhaps I should say, Mr.
Bonair, now?”</p>

<p>“Call me Charley always if you will, and let us
be true friends, my dear girl, instead of lovers,” he
pleaded, with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>Rosalind placed her cold little hand eagerly in his,
and answered:</p>

<p>“This is very sudden, and very hard on me, Charley,<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
because I have loved you dearly for a year, and looked
forward with joy to a life spent by your side. Before
I promise to release you, grant me one favor.”</p>

<p>“Name it, Rosalind.”</p>

<p>“You have not asked your new love yet, and you
are not sure she will love you in return?”</p>

<p>“I am reasonably sure,” he said, with the confidence
of a sanguine mind.</p>

<p>“How long will it be before you can have your
answer?”</p>

<p>“A week&mdash;perhaps two,” he replied, suddenly remembering
that Berry was yet precariously ill.</p>

<p>“Then this is what I ask you, Charley, dear&mdash;yes,
still dear, despite the wound in my heart. Keep our
secret until you have your new love’s acceptance of
your suit. Let us remain to the world lovers still, until
you are plighted to another. Then I will release you
from your vow.”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say,” he answered, so grateful
for her promise of release, that he did not think it
mattered going on with the farce of an engagement a
while longer.</p>

<p>“If it will make it any less painful for you, Rose,
you can say you jilted me, you know. I shouldn’t
mind at all!”</p>

<p>“Thank you&mdash;I will think it over,” she answered dejectedly,<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
and the last glimpse he had of her was just
as she hid her face in her hands again and sat silent,
like a statue of despair.</p>

<p>He went immediately down to the keeper’s cottage,
as he did every day, for news of Berry, and his heart
leaped with joy when Mrs. Cline told him there was a
marked change for the better, and the invalid had
begun to take notice and to try to talk a little.</p>

<p>“When the doctor came this morning he was so
pleased with the improvement, he said she was quite
sure to get well now,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” he cried fervently, and after a
momentary hesitation, he added earnestly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cline, do me one favor, and I will never forget
it. If that fellow, Weston, comes to see her again, do
not admit him to see the patient. Tell him she is improving,
but can see no one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do as you say, sir, but Lor’ bless you, some of
them actor folks comes here every day to ask about
her.”</p>

<p>“But remember, I wish to be the first one admitted
to her presence when she is able to see any one,” he
replied.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE HAPPY MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>But April had succeeded March before Berry was
fairly convalescent.</p>

<p>A long and weary month she had lain upon that
bed of pain before life struggled back for certain into
her weary, battered frame, and the light of memory
shone again in her big, pathetic brown eyes.</p>

<p>Then she began to get well very fast, and to betray
a great curiosity over everything, asking questions that
the doctor said might be freely answered.</p>

<p>So before she was permitted to see any one but her
nurses, she knew all there was to tell&mdash;that Charley
Bonair, the millionaire senator’s only son, had rescued
her from Bruin’s clutches at the peril of his own life,
and that the mysterious assailant had put a ball in his
shoulder as he bent over her in the pit.</p>

<p>“Do not tell me he was killed,” sobbed Berry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cline laughed reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, my dear young lady, although
Heaven only knows what might have happened only
for Sam and me coming up just then and scaring off
the vile woman that sought your death, for she might<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
have shot again and again. But we chased her away,
and opened the door of the pit, and found the bears
in an awful uproar, and there’s no telling what might
have happened next, only that we got you both out as
quick as possible and brought you to our house. Laws,
Mr. Bonair only had a bullet in his shoulder, and the
doctor soon got it out, but he stayed here two weeks,
afraid to be moved home, and even now he comes down
every day to ask after you, always bringing fresh
flowers to decorate your room. A mighty good heart
has Mr. Charley.”</p>

<p>Berry lay gazing at the fragrant flowers on the table,
a dreamy light in her great brown eyes, a faint flush
staining her pallid cheeks.</p>

<p>She was thinking how strange and sad it was that
their paths had crossed again so tragically&mdash;hers and
handsome, wicked Charley Bonair’s.</p>

<p>She called him wicked, because she remembered
vividly the night of their moonlight ride, when he had
asked her for her heart without her hand&mdash;oh, the
shame of it&mdash;promising she should be his sweetheart
even if he married Rosalind! Back over Berry’s mind,
in a flood tide of grief, rushed the memory of his
burning kiss, and her wild words when she had flung
his roses back into his face, wounding him with their
thorns, then leaped in a passion of wounded love and<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
pride out of the trap into the road, where, striking her
head on a rock, she had become unconscious for hours.</p>

<p>When she had yielded to the persuasions of the
theatrical people to become one of themselves, she had
done it with the resolve to place the whole width of the
world, if possible, between herself and Charley Bonair,
praying never to see his face again.</p>

<p>Now the work of almost a year was undone by the
cruelest chance in the world.</p>

<p>Alas, what strange fate had sent her unconsciously
to his home, beneath his very roof, when the cruel
wound had seared over, and she was learning to forget!</p>

<p>It was the very irony of fate that she should owe
her life to him, to Charley Bonair, the proud, handsome
profligate!</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried to herself, in bitterness of soul,
“I had rather have perished than owed my life to him!”
And suddenly she burst into the most piteous sobbing
Mrs. Cline had ever heard. It was just as though
her poor heart were broken, thought the sympathetic
soul.</p>

<p>“Ah, dear, dear, what a fool I was, blabbing out
everything at once! Now you will get worse for the
excitement, and I shall be to blame!” she cried out
piteously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, I&mdash;I&mdash;will be calm!” cried Berry, subduing
her sobs by a violent effort, as she put out her hand,
so frail and white.</p>

<p>“I am better now; I will not give way again. Tell
me more.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, miss&mdash;not till I see that my gabbling
has no ill effect on you,” Mrs. Cline replied uneasily.
But just then there was a light tap on the door that
opened into the hall, and when she went to it, there was
Bonair, asking anxiously:</p>

<p>“How is our little patient to-day, Mrs. Cline?”</p>

<p>How the musical voice thrilled Berry’s heart, stirring
it to subtle rapture! Alas, she did not hate him,
after all; she was turning faint and dizzy just with
the happiness of hearing him speak again! His faintest
whisper made her heart rejoice!</p>

<p>The voice ceased, and she heard Mrs. Cline saying:</p>

<p>“She is getting better fast, sir, but I fear I have
talked to her too much to-day, telling her about the
night you rescued her, and just now she had a hard
fit of crying from excitement.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” cried out Berry imploringly, but the
sound of her voice went to his heart, made him reckless;
he pushed past Mrs. Cline into the room, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, let me have just one peep at her, please!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cline, dazed and undecided, shut the door and<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
stood with her back against it, staring as Charley Bonair
dropped down on his knees, fixing adoring eyes
on the sick girl’s pallid, frightened face.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, little love! My own sweetheart,
found once more, and never to be lost again! For I am
free now, darling, and I will marry you to-morrow
if you will have me for your husband!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THEIR PLIGHTED VOWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was enough to blow out the faint spark of Berry’s
life, the sudden shock of seeing her lover, and hearing
those startling words from his lips, but, happily,
“joy never kills.”</p>

<p>Now at the sight of his handsome face that she
had never expected to see again in life, above all at
the sound of his musical voice, uttering words she
had not dared to fancy on his lips, such a wave of
rapturous emotion thrilled Berry from head to foot,
that she could not utter a sound. Her only response
to her lover’s ardent words was a sudden rain of blissful
tears that relieved the tension of her surcharged
heart.</p>

<p>With his own soft handkerchief Charley Bonair
wiped away those shining drops, murmuring fond
words, quite heedless of the gaping Mrs. Cline, who
looked and listened, thinking to herself:</p>

<p>“Well, I never! Has the man gone clean daft, promising
to marry this poor little actress, when the folks
up at the mansion say that he’s engaged to that grand,
rich New York heiress, Miss Montague!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>As she had known him from his boyhood, and did
not stand at all in awe of him, she cried, in righteous
indignation:</p>

<p>“For shame, Mr. Charley, trying to flirt with that
poor little sick girl, that don’t know you as well as
I do, or she would not listen to your foolishness! Get
out of here, now, do, before you scare my patient into
fits!”</p>

<p>At this the happy young fellow, remembering her
presence for the first time, got up deliberately from
his knees, where he was kneeling by Berry, and marching
to Mrs. Cline, took her, playfully, by the shoulders,
and put her outside the door, saying gayly:</p>

<p>“You don’t understand a word of this, of course, but
I will explain it all to your satisfaction if you will stay
out here till I get an answer to my proposal, will you?”
pleadingly.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;yes, I suppose I must, if you order me to,
Mr. Charley, but I don’t know what the doctor, and
the nurse, and Miss Montague, too, will say to all this
goings on, sir, especially if the poor young girl gets
a relapse from excitement,” she complained.</p>

<p>“She will not get a relapse. Happiness never killed
anybody!” cried the young man, beaming happily upon
her, as he shut her outside, and went back to the blushing,
trembling little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>“My darling, please forgive me for taking you by
storm this way, but I never had any patience in my
life, and how could I have now, when I have the sweetest
story in the world to tell you? Listen, Berry, my
dearest: I have loved you and you alone, since the
first moment I saw your lovely face shining down on
me from the cottage window framed in morning-glory
vines. From that moment your face has been
the star of my life’s horizon, and your sweet love song
has haunted many a dream. But I was betrothed to
another, a proud, rich girl, my equal in birth and position,
so at first I did not think of breaking my vow.
Then you faded from my life, and I feared you were
dead until I saw you on the boards of the theater that
night, in my own home, a very queen of love and
beauty. I knew you again in a moment. My little
Berry could not hide from me under the pseudonym of
Vera Vane.”</p>

<p>Berry’s soft cheeks dimpled into a smile at that,
and taking her small hand, he held it tightly clasped in
a warm, sweet pressure, while he continued:</p>

<p>“That very night I had come home from a long
yachting trip, trying to forget you, and had made up
my mind to settle down and make everybody but myself
happy by marrying Rosalind. But my presence
was as yet unknown to my people, and when I saw you<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
again, Berry, and knew that you lived, more sweet and
lovely than ever, I could not bear the thought of my
betrothed. I stole away when the play was over and
went out into the grounds to brood over my trouble.
While I smoked a cigar, hidden on a seat in some shrubberies,
you came by and stopped and talked to yourself
until the old fortune teller came to upbraid you
for not keeping your engagement promptly. Do you
remember it, Berry?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, yes&mdash;and you were there close by?” she
breathed, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes, almost close enough to touch you: I was
tempted, indeed, to rush to you and clasp you to my
heart, but I had not forgotten the night I kissed you
when you flung my roses in my face and scratched me
with the sharp thorns; I did not care to risk such vixenish
resentment again, although that kiss, believe me,
was worth all I suffered for it.”</p>

<p>She listened, eagerly, to every word, flushing and
paling, delicately as a rose, her large, dilated brown
eyes drinking in every tender word. Charley Bonair
thought, in spite of her thinness, that she was as lovely
as a dream. Suffering had only refined her beauty.</p>

<p>She had scarcely a word to say; she only listened,
drinking in his voice like heavenly music, and he, gazing<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
at her and stroking her little hand, went on with
his explanations, saying:</p>

<p>“I heard all you and the old woman were saying,
and was vastly amazed at your credulity in believing
her silly yarns. Well, soon after you left, I started
down to see Zilla, and heard your cries of terror,
so by hurrying my pace I was able to get there
in time to save you from being quite killed by the
angry brute. I suppose Mrs. Cline has told you everything
that happened afterward, as far as she knew.”</p>

<p>She murmured yes, and he added joyously:</p>

<p>“What she did not know, was that as soon as I found
out you would live, I resolved to break my engagement
with Rosalind, if you would forgive the past
and have me. I have carried out my intentions, and
am free to offer you my heart and my name. Can
you love me, little girl, in spite of my glaring faults,
and take me in hand to reform me?”</p>

<p>His tender eyes shone love into hers, and he looked
as though he meditated kissing her at any moment.
Berry felt dizzy all at once, with a strange feeling,
as if she were floating in air on rosy clouds of bliss.</p>

<p>“Oh, Berry, why don’t you speak? Are you angry
with me still? Will you not forgive and love me?”
cried her ardent lover, with dawning anxiety, for he<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
felt her little hand growing chill and fluttering like
a bird in his clasp.</p>

<p>She half sobbed:</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, I am almost afraid!”</p>

<p>“Afraid, my darling&mdash;of what, pray?”</p>

<p>“To&mdash;marry&mdash;you, Mr. Bonair! Because you are
all so rich and grand&mdash;your people, you know, and
they might not care for you to marry simple little me,
instead of the proud heiress, Rosalind!” she panted
questioningly, while blushes came and went deliciously
on her thin cheeks.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair looked sober for a moment, then
laughed again.</p>

<p>“Ah! now I am up against the real thing!” he exclaimed.
“It is quite true, Berry, darling, that they
may object a little at first, but when they see how
sweet and charming you are, dad and my pretty sisters
will surely come around and love you almost as well
as I do. Of course they would make no end of a
bother if I asked their leave first, but I don’t mean
to do it, you see! We’ll get married first, my angel,
and announce it afterward. I can take the Clines into
the secret, and we could be married here to-morrow, in
this room, if you will consent, Berry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am afraid, afraid!” she moaned nervously.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Berry. Are you afraid that dad will<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
cut us off with a shilling if I marry you? Do you
object to being a poor man’s bride?” her lover demanded,
rather sternly, in his impatience.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! Mr. Bonair&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Call me, Charley,” he interrupted imploringly.</p>

<p>“Charley, then! I’ve always been poor, you know,
and I shouldn’t mind it all with you, dear, if&mdash;if&mdash;you
are sure you will never repent and be sorry I
married you.”</p>

<p>“You will marry me, then, darling?” He bent and
took the kiss he was longing for. “Bless you, dear,
your Charley will never repent he won such a prize!
It may be you that will be sorry, for I have got
a hard name, you know, and need reforming,” he said
truthfully.</p>

<p>“I will love you so, my Charley, it will make a better
man of you!” she cried tenderly, giving way to the
rapture of her happy love at last. Then, as a light
tap sounded on the door: “Oh, dear, we were quite
forgetting poor Mrs. Cline, dearest. Do let her in,
and explain everything, or she will think this interview
very improper.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ALL FOR LOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Charley Bonair was a man of action.</p>

<p>Having resolved to marry Berenice Vining, he knew
that he would have to encounter strong family opposition,
and foreboded that every possible means would
be adopted to prevent the marriage.</p>

<p>Therefore he decided to forestall family interference
by marrying the young girl first, and trying to
reconcile his relatives afterward.</p>

<p>His sanguine disposition made him believe that this
would be an easy task. And even if it failed he felt
quite independent, even in the face of possible disinheritance.</p>

<p>His dead mother had left her own handsome fortune
to be divided between her three children on the
coming of age of Marie, the youngest.</p>

<p>Charley thought he and his love could get along
very well on his portion, especially as Berenice was
used to poverty and would not really know how to be
extravagant.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to have the ceremony quietly
to-morrow and he would then feel surer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>He took Mrs. Cline partially into his confidence,
telling her that he and Berenice had been lovers before
and parted through a misunderstanding that he
had now explained away.</p>

<p>The next thing he had to do&mdash;the hardest of all&mdash;was
to acquaint Rosalind with the fact of his acceptance
by her rival.</p>

<p>He felt keenly how unwelcome the news must be
to the girl who had loved him and hoped to be his
bride, but he assured himself that she would soon be
consoled by the attentions of other lovers.</p>

<p>“I am not much of a prize for any girl, if it were not
for father’s money, anyway. She will soon forget me,”
he thought, with unwonted seriousness, for at the
thought of wedding little Berry, all the follies of his
youth rose up blackly before his mind’s eye, with a
poignant sense of regret.</p>

<p>As he strolled slowly backward to the mansion, in
the late afternoon amid the sweet sights and sounds
and perfume of spring at her loveliest, he caught himself
wondering “if the old man would ‘cut up very
rough’ over the mésalliance he was going to make,”
and if his dainty sisters would turn up their pretty
noses at his humble bride.</p>

<p>“It is very likely they may, but if so I must face
the music and accept my fate. One thing is certain. I<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
would not give up my bonnie bride for the whole Bonair
fortune, although I should like a generous slice
of it for my bride’s sake as well as my own. Heigh-ho,
he may cut me off with a shilling, though, and then I
shall only get the modest portion from my mother.
Without that we should have to live on bread and
cheese and kisses, my love and I.” He threw back his
handsome head with a happy laugh, and went his way,
whistling a plaintive Irish air that seemed to chime with
his mood:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“My fortunes are not what for your sake I could wish them to be;

</div><div class="indent5">I ask nothing more.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>With a heart elate with love and joy and triumph,
he entered the house and sought Rosalind, but she
was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>He sent up a servant to her room to ask for an
interview, eager to have the painful task over that he<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
might give himself up wholly to the happiness that
sent his pulses bounding joyously along his veins.</p>

<p>The servant came back quickly to say that Miss Montague
was in bed with a sick headache, and had desired
not to be disturbed.</p>

<p>With that he began to feel a little remorseful, saying
to himself:</p>

<p>“Poor Rose! no doubt she has wept herself into a
headache over losing me. I wish she had not loved so
well! It makes me feel badly because I know I don’t
deserve one of her tears.”</p>

<p>He was interrupted here by a visit from the detective
who came, as he had done several times before,
to report that he had made no headway with the
case.</p>

<p>“The old Indian seeress has covered up her tracks
completely. I cannot get the slightest clew to her
whereabouts or her identity, and I almost believe that
some disguised person played the part of fortune teller,
and may be laughing in secret at our fruitless search,”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>While the young man stared at him in startled wonder,
he added:</p>

<p>“I have made up my mind that we can do nothing
more until Miss Vane, the actress, is able to speak<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
for herself. Doubtless she might tell us something
that would furnish a clew. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“It may be so, but I doubt it. She is fast regaining
strength, and I hope may soon be interviewed on
the subject, although the physician interdicts such conversation
now,” Charley answered.</p>

<p>“In that case I will wait before I take any further
steps. If she cannot furnish any further clew it will
be useless for me to go on, as the murderer or murderess,
as the case may be, is securely entrenched behind
a disguise we cannot penetrate,” reluctantly owned
the detective.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair, after a moment’s meditation, agreed
with him that it must be so.</p>

<p>“One more question,” said the baffled sleuth: “Do
you know of any malignant enemy Miss Vane can
have?”</p>

<p>In his masculine obtuseness, Charley quickly answered:</p>

<p>“No, I do not know that she has an enemy in the
world.”</p>

<p>The detective mused a moment, then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Sometimes love can be as cruel as hate. I wonder
if the beautiful young girl had a rejected lover?”</p>

<p>He started when he was answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, perhaps I am getting on the right track now!
Where is this man? Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He is the manager of the company in which Miss
Vane was the leading lady. His name is Willis
Weston, and he may be seen every night on the boards
of the Olympia Theater.”</p>

<p>“Ah-h, then I have seen him already! A clever
actor and a handsome man, on or off the stage. Perhaps
this may give me a clew. I shall look into his
past, and in the meantime, sir, as soon as the young
lady can safely give me an interview, please let me
know, for surely she may be able to throw some light
on the darkness of this mysterious case.”</p>

<p>He bowed himself out, and Charley was about to
leave the room also when he was startled by the appearance
of Miss Montague’s maid, Suzette. She curtsied,
and said:</p>

<p>“My mistress begins to feel a little better, sir, and
would be pleased to see you for a while in her boudoir.”</p>

<p>“I will come at once,” he replied, following the maid
in his eagerness to be off with the old love, but saying
to himself humorously:</p>

<p>“What fools men are, anyway! They would be lots
better off if they left the women alone and remained
bachelors all their lives, but instead of that they must<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
always be getting into hot water over the pretty dears.
We are weak as children, where woman is concerned,
that’s the truth. Now, I wonder what is up with Rosalind?
I pray Heaven she does not treat me to a fit
of hysterics.”</p>

<p>Suzette opened a door into a shaded rose-hung
boudoir, and disappeared.</p>

<p>He stepped across the threshold and was alone with
Rosalind.</p>

<p>The slighted beauty lay gracefully posing among the
silken pillows of an Oriental couch.</p>

<p>She wore a negligee robe of soft white lansdowne,
embroidered in blue flowers that matched the striking
hue of her beautiful eyes. The golden lengths of
her thick hair flowed unconfined over her shoulders,
and her face, even to her lips, wore a bluish pallor of
illness and suffering.</p>

<p>At Charley’s entrance a melancholy smile curved
her lips, and she extended her white hand, glittering
with diamonds, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Dear Charley, I was really too ill to receive you.
See to what a plight your falsity has brought me. But
I hoped against hope you had relented, and wished
everything to be as before, so I sent for you. Ah, tell
me, dear, is it true?”</p>

<p>Charley’s heart quickly sank like a stone in his<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
breast, for he saw that his presentiment was right; hysterics
were impending, sure enough!</p>

<p>He felt like swearing, but he controlled the impulse
and stood gazing at her, speechlessly, while she
raved on:</p>

<p>“Oh, Charley, dearest, I’ve thought it all over until
my brain is almost wild, and I’ve decided that I cannot,
will not give you up to my rival! I have the
first, best claim, and I will yield it to no other. Ah,
say that you will love me still, that you will be true
to your vows!”</p>

<p>“Here is a pretty pickle!” groaned the young man to
himself, in a sort of consternation at the situation, his
generous heart touched by her display of emotion, for
her beauty and her sorrow were very striking, almost
theatrical.</p>

<p>But he pulled himself together, and said gently, with
an abashed air in his self-reproach:</p>

<p>“Don’t say another word, please, Rosalind; you are
only making matters worse. It is too late!”</p>

<p>“Too late!” she almost shrieked, and he answered
seriously:</p>

<p>“Yes, forever, too late. I’ve proposed to the other
girl, and have been accepted.”</p>

<p>A cry of rage burst from Rosalind’s lips, and her
blue eyes blazed with the fire of jealous hate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>She sat erect suddenly and shook her small, jeweled
fist close to his face.</p>

<p>“Coward! Traitor! You have turned my love to
hate, and you shall pay dear for the slight you have
put upon me!”</p>

<p>“Do you threaten me with a suit for breach of
promise?” he demanded laughingly.</p>

<p>“Worse than that, far worse!” she answered fiercely,
adding: “I know who my secret rival is already&mdash;that
miserable little actress that used to be Berry Vining,
and I will have my revenge on you both!
Now go!”</p>

<p>Charley obeyed her with alacrity!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE NEXT DAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Miss Montague’s headache lasted till the afternoon
of the next day, and she denied herself to every one
but her maid, keeping quiet, as she said, to overcome
the attack, but in reality plotting schemes for revenge
on her successful rival.</p>

<p>Her seclusion ended, she appeared at luncheon, exquisitely
gowned, and with a becoming pallor that
witnessed her recent sufferings.</p>

<p>But all the ladies at the table were pale, for that
matter, and they had pink eyelids, as if from recent
weeping, while in their demeanor to Rosalind was
mingled overweening pity and sympathetic tenderness
for her illness.</p>

<p>So she condescended graciously:</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s talk of it any more. I’m better now.”</p>

<p>But it seemed to her, presently, that there was something
else in the air, and, glancing at a vacant chair,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Charley come to luncheon? Is he
sick? Is that why all of you look so tearful?”</p>

<p>With that one of the girls choked back a sob and
answered bitterly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>“He isn’t sick, oh, no; much worse! He has gone
crazy!”</p>

<p>“Hush, dearie!” admonished Madam Fortescue,
glancing significantly at the servant in waiting, while
she added, to Rosalind, kindly and with dignity:</p>

<p>“The news of Charley’s escapade will keep till we
have finished luncheon.”</p>

<p>After that no one had much appetite, and the four
soon adjourned to a private room where Rosalind said
brusquely:</p>

<p>“If there’s anything to tell, let me hear it quickly&mdash;I
never could bear suspense.”</p>

<p>As they hesitated, with great eyes of sorrow and
sympathy, she continued:</p>

<p>“Why do you all look at me so strangely and pityingly?
Has Charley done something very bad indeed?”</p>

<p>“He has gone crazy!” again answered Marie angrily,
mopping her wet eyes with her lace handkerchief.</p>

<p>“It will break your heart!” sobbed Lucile, adding:</p>

<p>“Dear Rosalind, please do not be angry with us
when you hear it. We are not to blame, and we will
love you all the more for the grief he has caused
you.”</p>

<p>“My dear girls, you will drive poor Rosalind wild.<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
Let me tell her the cruel truth at once,” exclaimed
Madam Fortescue, and taking the girl’s hand, tenderly,
in hers, she said tearfully:</p>

<p>“I grieve to tell you that my nephew, Charley Bonair,
has to-day capped the climax of his follies by making
a clandestine marriage with the sick actress whom he
saved from the bear pit the night of the ball.”</p>

<p>“Oh, heavens!” gasped Rosalind, in very genuine
horror and indignation, for she had not expected the
climax so soon.</p>

<p>She sat gazing at the speaker with a pale, stricken
face, while she went on bitterly:</p>

<p>“It seems Charley had known the girl before that
night. He met her first in the town where you live
before she went upon the stage, and fell in love with
her then, so he says. But she had some sort of a
strange disappearance, then, and he believed her dead
until coming home, unexpectedly, the night of our
grand ball, he saw her on the stage and knew her at
once for the missing girl. He was so agitated between
his duty to you and his love for her that he did
not make his presence known to us, but went out into
the grounds to overcome his agitation. There he had
the good fortune, as he calls it, of saving her life.
The romance of this incident increased his love to recklessness
so that he threw pride and duty to the winds<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
and proposed to the girl yesterday. She accepted
the offer, and this morning he procured a minister,
and they were married, with the Clines as witnesses.”</p>

<p>Lucile chimed in furiously:</p>

<p>“He had the impudence to come and tell us all about
it when the thing was irrevocably done, and to beg
us to accept that nobody for a sister!”</p>

<p>Rosalind would never be paler than now, as she
sat and listened, speechless with rage, at Charley’s
escapade.</p>

<p>Where were all the clever plans she had made for
circumventing him now? All shattered to pieces by
this action of the ardent lover, who had cleverly forestalled
everything by his hasty wedding.</p>

<p>“We will never accept her for a sister&mdash;never! We
will never forgive him for the slight to you whom
we loved already as a sister!” sobbed Marie, and at
this juncture Rosalind thought it was time to fall back,
half fainting, in her seat, but not to go entirely unconscious
until she had heard all there was to tell.</p>

<p>They ran to chafe her face and hands and to drop
tender little kisses on her brow, until she seemed to
revive, and murmured faintly:</p>

<p>“I am better now. Go on, tell me everything.”</p>

<p>“Of course, we overwhelmed him with bitter reproaches,”<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
declared Marie, “and we told him we
wanted nothing more to do with him, or with the low
nobody he has married.”</p>

<p>“And he said&mdash;what?” demanded Rosalind.</p>

<p>“He pleaded for her at first, and then when he saw
we were not to be placated, he grew angry, too, and
left the house, saying he would rather have his little
bride’s love than ours. So as soon as he left we
telegraphed father, in Washington, to come home at
once and see if he could do anything to break up the
match, for Charley had suddenly lost his mind and
married a low actress that we could never receive in
the family, to say nothing of the slight he had put
upon you!”</p>

<p>“Cruel! cruel! Oh, my heart will break! I can
never hold up my head again for very shame; me,
Rosalind Montague, to be jilted for a creature like
that&mdash;the daughter of the New Market tailoress, a
woman that worked by the day in a shop!” groaned
Rosalind hysterically.</p>

<p>“Then you know the girl?” asked Madam Fortescue.</p>

<p>“Yes, she grew up in abject poverty there in New
Market. Her father drove a delivery wagon&mdash;till he
died&mdash;for the tailor his wife sewed for, and there<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
were a host of children, and this girl, the youngest,
who grew up idle and rather pretty so that she cared
for nothing but flirting and flaunting about, never
soiling her hands with honest work. I knew that
Charley flirted with her a little, but mamma advised
me not to find fault with him, saying it wouldn’t
amount to anything. Soon after she disappeared from
the town and I never saw her again until that night
of the play. I was almost sure that Vera Vane was
little frisky, flirting Berry Vining, the little schemer,
that has cut me out of my lover!”</p>

<p>They hastened to caress her again, assuring her of
their warm sympathy, and adding their unalterable
determination never to accept the scheming little actress
for a sister. Charley could never be their brother
again, either; they would punish him by treating him
as a stranger.</p>

<p>“If he had told you that he loved her best and
wanted his freedom, it would not have seemed quite so
wicked, but when he told us he had done so, we did
not believe him, as you would have told us if such were
the case,” added Mrs. Fortescue.</p>

<p>“Oh, how could he be totally false? He has never
breathed one word of all this to me. If he had I
should have freely confided in all of you. You know I<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
have made no secret of my troubles,” sighed Rosalind.</p>

<p>“Only wait till papa comes and he will find a way,
I’m sure, to break the marriage and bring poor Charley
back to his senses,” declared Marie, between tears and
anger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FAIR BRIDE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Charley Bonair had indeed gone away from his
sisters in an angry mood, stung by their reproaches and
embittered by their sharp abuse of his wife, the scheming
nobody, as they did not scruple to call her to his
face.</p>

<p>He also, in the fullness of his happiness, had sent
off a telegram to his father before he had carried his
news up to Bonair, and it ran very simply:</p>

<p>“Rosalind and I broke off recently, and I have to-day
married another girl who has the truest heart and fairest
face in the world, so that I confidently hope for
your forgiveness and your blessing.”</p>

<p>Charley thought this was a masterly stroke, the
prompt confession of his mésalliance, and hoped much
from it, little dreaming of the malicious message that
followed it from his sisters, entreating Senator Bonair
to return home and do something or other to Charley
in punishment for the disgrace he had brought on the
family, marrying a scheming little actress, an out-and-out
nobody, and jilting his beautiful promised bride.</p>

<p>In their anger, the sisters did not care to recall the<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
praises they had bestowed on Berry for her beauty and
her clever acting, nor the pity they had felt for her
after the accident that so nearly ended her life. Her
unparalleled impudence in marrying Charley because
he asked her and because she loved him blotted out
everything else in her favor.</p>

<p>But Charley, returning to the cottage, basked in
the smiles of his charming bride, and resolutely put
dull care behind him.</p>

<p>It is wonderful what miracles love can work in a
day!</p>

<p>Berenice, who had been convalescing slowly and
listlessly because her sad heart took but little interest
in life, had changed in a night and day to a lovely,
hopeful creature whose brown eyes glowed with love
and joy, while her thin cheeks had put on the roses of
nature under Charley’s fond, eager glance, that was to
her like the sun shining upon a flower, unfolding it to
glorious bloom.</p>

<p>The happy excitement had loaned her such fictitious
strength that the nurse had permitted her to sit up
in a chair for the wedding, and Mrs. Cline had gone
to a shop and bought for her a simple white robe with
white laces and ribbons to make it look bridelike.</p>

<p>Thus attired, and with her little hand in Charley’s
she had murmured timidly, after the minister, the sweet<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
words of the service that made her the sweetest and
happiest of brides.</p>

<p>When it was all over they had all gone out quietly
and left them alone for a blissful half hour.</p>

<p>Charley knelt down by his bonnie bride and clasped
her to his heart.</p>

<p>“My queen!” he murmured, kissing her hands, her
face and hair in an ecstasy of triumphant love.</p>

<p>She drooped against his breast, very tired, but very
happy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not know how to realize my bliss!” she
murmured. “I am really your wife, Charley, your own
wife, and you are my husband! Ah, it does not seem
possible! I loved you in vain so long, I almost fear
I am dreaming.”</p>

<p>“It is no dream, but the sweetest reality in the world&mdash;to
me!” he cried ardently, stopping the words on
her lips with kisses. And so they went on, until Mrs.
Cline returned and said:</p>

<p>“Now, my dear sir, you must go out and leave
your lady to rest. She has stayed up too long already.”</p>

<p>Charley obeyed reluctantly, and beckoning her to
the door, said, in a whisper:</p>

<p>“You will have to prepare a room for me down<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
here, Mrs. Cline, for I am determined to stay and
nurse my lovely bride back to health.”</p>

<p>“That can be quickly done, sir. Her improvement
is miraculous already, and will, no doubt, continue
with due care. As to a room, I can make you
comfortable, no doubt, but you will miss the grandeur
of Bonair,” the woman answered, with a curtsey.</p>

<p>Charley answered, with a laugh:</p>

<p>“I may have to miss those grandeurs always, henceforward,
Mrs. Cline, for if my father should be as
angry as my sisters are he will probably disinherit me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no fear of that I think, sir, and you his only
son, the apple of his eye, as it were. And, dear me,
sir, if he should be angry at you, why, what would he
be at me and Sam for aiding and abetting your marriage?
He would very likely turn us out of this
place!” cried the woman uneasily, for her many years
at Bonair had endeared the place to her heart.</p>

<p>“If he does I will find you another place as good,
so don’t begin to worry yet. Let us look on the bright
side as long as we can!” cried sanguine Charley.</p>

<p>And from that moment he began to live up to his
creed, never uttering a word of apprehension as to
the outcome of his marriage.</p>

<p>He had followed up his telegram to his father with
a long explanatory letter in which he did full justice<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
to the charms of his bride; but to neither one came
any reply, although up at Bonair the sisters had received
a speedy answer that read briefly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am horrified, but do not see anything that I can
do. Will leave at once in special car for home.”</p>
</div>

<p>So up at Bonair, as the days slipped away, they
began to expect the master, but they kept it secret
from Charley, whom they scornfully said was keeping
up his dignity down yonder in his fool’s paradise.</p>

<p>In fact, Charley did not go near them again.</p>

<p>He had a sense of bitter outrage in the cavalier treatment
they had accorded him, and kept away from
Bonair trying to forget them in the new and delightful
role of benedict.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the news had got into the daily
papers and created its due sensation.</p>

<p>Reporters flocked to the keeper’s cottage, and
Charley submitted to interviews for the sake of setting
his bride right with the public. Meager details of the
romance were given out and created considerable sensation;
but the still delicate bride saw no one as yet,
although the members of her company called in a body,
headed by Mr. Weston, to offer congratulations.</p>

<p>Charley entertained them cordially, excusing Berenice
on the score of her weakness, and, saying he hoped<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
she would soon get strong enough to go away with
him on their honeymoon trip. He added genially, that
she could never tread the boards again. She must
content herself with entertaining her husband.</p>

<p>He took pains to show great friendliness for Mr.
Weston at whose secret pain he very easily guessed,
and his cordiality won him a true friend whose worth
was latterly to be well proved.</p>

<p>So the days slipped away, and Berry would never
forget that morning when she first sat up for the day
in a pretty house gown of rosy pink cashmere, cascaded
in lace, that Charley himself had gone shopping to buy
for his darling. She glanced up as Charley entered,
and at sight of his eager face, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What has happened, dearest, that you look so excited?”</p>

<p>He clasped her to his heart, covering the sweet face
with ardent kisses till she laughingly cried for mercy.</p>

<p>Then he gave her the great bunch of pink roses he
had brought, and explained:</p>

<p>“I have great news, my darling girl. I have just
heard that father arrived home unexpectedly last evening,
and although it seems strange and rather discouraging
that he has not sent word down to me, still
I shall do my duty by going up to call on him, and
if he has forgiven me I shall bring him down to call<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
on his new daughter. If he should be angry I will
soon return alone!” And with a stifled sigh of keen
anxiety, he embraced his trembling bride and hurried
away.</p>

<p>Left alone, she threw herself down nervously to rest
on her couch, quite frightened at the idea of meeting
the great, rich senator, her husband’s father.</p>

<p>She need not have been so nervous and uneasy had
she but known.</p>

<p>Hours slipped away, and Charley did not return,
and her suspense grew almost unbearable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cline came in at last with such a pale, indignant
face that the nervous young bride nearly fainted
with dread.</p>

<p>“Something dreadful must have happened to make
you look so strange,” she cried uneasily, adding: “I
fear you have had bad news for me.”</p>

<p>Her heart nearly stopped its beating when Mrs. Cline
answered angrily:</p>

<p>“Bad! I should say so, but try to hear it the best
you can, dear young lady, for that high and mighty
man, your husband’s father, has had Mr. Charley arrested
and clapped in jail on a charge of insanity!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BRIBING A BRIDE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Cline’s startling announcement was like a bolt
of lightning falling from a clear sky.</p>

<p>The young bride uttered one horrified cry, then fell
back in her chair, half fainting, her big, frightened
brown eyes staring wildly at Mrs. Cline, who, in a very
tempest of excitement, continued to rage.</p>

<p>“Never heard of such high-handed villainy in my
life, never! No wonder you look so white and scared,
my dear young lady! Here, drink this wine to nerve
you while I tell you the rest.”</p>

<p>She pressed the glass to Berry’s lips and forced her
to swallow a few mouthfuls, then began again:</p>

<p>“Try to bear it the best you can, for it can’t be kept
from you, all this bad news, and you must keep your
wits about you to plan something to do for your husband.
Yes, cry all you want to, it’ll relieve your heart;
and this outrage is enough to make the very angels
weep! The servants at Bonair tell a terrible tale about
the fuss between the father and son! They say there
was an awful scene between them when Mr. Charley
went in this morning. The senator was in a tearing-down<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
rage, and would not listen to a word of excuse
for his marriage, but cursed and abused him, and finally
turned him out of doors, disinherited. And the worst
of it was that he had already caused a warrant to be
got, arresting him for insanity, and the officers took him
just as he was leaving his father’s house, all broke up
with sorrow and despair.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Heaven! my poor husband!” moaned Berenice,
heartbroken and bewildered.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it an outrage!” cried the woman indignantly.
“And to climax the meanness, Mrs. Bonair,
what else do you think that heartless old hunks of
a senator did? He got mad at my husband for letting
the wedding be at our home, and has discharged him
from his position at Bonair, and ordered him to vacate
this cottage as soon as he can pack up his goods.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven! that you should suffer for our fault.
This is terrible. It were better I had perished in
Zilla’s clutches than to live and involve poor Charley
and his friends in such misery!” sobbed Berry.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at it that way, dear young lady,” condoled
Mrs. Cline, who, having now blurted out the
whole story, became less excited and eager to soothe the
distressed young bride, so she continued:</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, we can soon get another place&mdash;sooner,
I expect, than the senator can suit himself to<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
another man. And we aren’t penniless, either. We
have a tidy bit of savings put by, besides the nice gift
of money, so don’t worry over that! The thing is to
get Mr. Charley out of jail as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“But, oh, how shall we do it? It is cruel, cruel to
have placed him there! We know well he is not insane!”
wept Berry.</p>

<p>“Of course he is not,” agreed the woman; “and my
husband says a lawyer must be got at once and set to
work to get him out of that as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Hark! the doorbell!” cried Berry, and Mrs. Cline
went to obey the summons.</p>

<p>She returned quickly with an official-looking letter.</p>

<p>“It is for you&mdash;brought down by one of Senator
Bonair’s servants, who will wait for the answer,” she
said, in high excitement.</p>

<p>The startled bride took the aggressive-looking envelope,
with fingers that shook as she tore it open.</p>

<p>Her eyes were so blurred by tears she could scarcely
read, but presently it all came to her that Senator
Bonair was making her a cold business proposition to
consent to a prompt divorce from his son upon the
payment of a handsome sum of money.</p>

<p>The tears rushed to her eyes&mdash;tears of burning indignation&mdash;and
her heart beat suffocatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>“What does the old villain want of you, if I may
ask?” queried the curious Mrs. Cline.</p>

<p>Berry handed her the letter to read, saying bitterly:</p>

<p>“He wishes to bribe me&mdash;Charley’s bride of a week&mdash;to
consent to a divorce.”</p>

<p>“The mean old tyrant! He ought to be hung!” ejaculated
the woman, as her eyes devoured the curt note.
She handed it back, and asked:</p>

<p>“What shall you say to this insult, dearie?”</p>

<p>“Only give me a pen and I will show you!” cried
Berenice, her eyes flashing through their bitter tears.
She seized it and wrote, in a nervous, trembling hand,
across the back of the senator’s sheet:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those whom God has joined together, let not man
put asunder!”</p>
</div>

<p>To these words the bride wrote her full name, in a
large, aggressive hand:</p>

<p>“Berenice Vining Bonair.”</p>

<p>“I guess that will settle him for good!” laughed Mrs.
Cline, as she handed Berry a fresh envelope to address
to Senator Bonair.</p>

<p>This done, she carried the letter quickly to the waiting
messenger, saying, with a proud toss of the head:</p>

<p>“There’s a letter for your master, and much good<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
may it do him! There’s some folks whose principles
he can’t buy with his yellow gold!”</p>

<p>She was turning to retrace her steps when she saw
Mr. Weston coming up to the door with a pale, excited
face.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning!” he exclaimed courteously. “I
hope the invalid&mdash;Mrs. Bonair&mdash;can see me this evening
for a few minutes. I have just heard the shocking
news about her husband, and came to see her to
offer my services to do anything she wishes, providing,
of course, she has no nearer friends she would
prefer to act for her in the case.”</p>

<p>“Bless you, sir, I don’t think she knows anybody
in San Francisco but us two, and poor Sam is so upset
with his discharge off the place, and moving orders
at the same time, that I don’t believe he hardly knows
where he’s at, sir; and it seems like Heaven must have
sent you to my poor lady’s relief!” cried Mrs. Cline,
ushering him straight into Berry’s presence without
thinking it necessary to ask permission.</p>

<p>Berry was sobbing, bitterly, with her face in her
hands, and she looked up with a start that made him
say deprecatingly:</p>

<p>“Forgive this intrusion, but I came to see if I
couldn’t help you. I know the outrage your husband
has suffered, and he will need a friend to look after<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
his interests. Do you wish me to act as your friend
in this matter?”</p>

<p>“Ah, this is very noble in you, Mr. Weston. A
friend in need is a friend indeed. I accept your offer
in the same spirit it is offered, and am most grateful,”
faltered Berry, giving him her hand which he pressed,
cordially, then released, saying:</p>

<p>“Now I am very glad, indeed, that I came. Of
course, this absurd charge cannot be proved against
your husband, and the whole affair is spite work, still
he may be imprisoned for days and kept in suspense
when prompt action might procure speedy trial of his
case and consequent freedom. Having your leave to
represent you in this case, I shall engage a lawyer, who,
with a writ of habeas corpus, can secure Mr. Bonair’s
immediate release and trial on the groundless charge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank Heaven&mdash;and you!” cried the bride fervently.
“Oh, then perhaps he need not, poor boy, spend
the terrible night in prison!”</p>

<p>“That I cannot promise you certainly, but I will
make all possible haste to restore him to you quickly.
In order to do this I must be going. Farewell, and
keep up a brave heart. This is only a temporary affliction;
it will soon be over,” he added cheerfully, bowing
himself out, leaving Berry with a lighter heart, though
her tears flowed fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>“You are clean wore out with your troubles, poor
soul!” cried Mrs. Cline. “Now you must lie down
and rest a while, so as not to get sick again, won’t you?
For we shall have our hands full now, me a-packing
up, and Sam a-looking out for a place to move to,
see? But we shan’t desert you, you poor lamb, nor
Mr. Charley, either; for no matter where we go, you
can come with us, and he can, too, until he gets fixed
for that honeymoon trip he’s been planning this week!
Though dear knows if he can afford it now, because
he has only an allowance from his father, and I don’t
know if he has saved any of it or not! But there’s
money coming to him from his mother’s estate before
long, and that’ll fix him up nicely, you see.”</p>

<p>While she chattered on, Mrs. Cline got Berry to lie
down on her little white couch for her much-needed
rest, and then she went out to see to the packing up
of her household goods, preparatory to giving up the
cottage to another tenant.</p>

<p>Many tears fell as she moved about her work with
the assistance of her yellow-faced Chinese boy of all
work, for she had come here a bride, eighteen years
ago, and fondly hoped to spend her life in the cottage
with Sam. But fate had willed otherwise, and
with a sad heart she prepared to go.</p>

<p>But not for all that did Mrs. Cline repent for one<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
moment her kindness to Mr. Charley and his bonnie
bride, although that had got her into trouble with the
master and banishment from Bonair.</p>

<p>“I’d do the same thing over again, if I knew beforehand
what was going to happen!” she vowed
stoutly.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">FORGETTING THE WORLD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The time is late summer on the bleak coast of Cornwall,
a year and three months since the day when
Charley Bonair walked out of the courtroom in San
Francisco, cleared of the charge of insanity brought
by his nearest and dearest relatives, and freed by the
efforts of the man who had loved Berry so loyally that
his friendship became her stay in the time of her sore
need.</p>

<p>Grateful to those who had befriended him, embittered
by persecution, Charley Bonair and his lovely
bride had exiled themselves within a week after his
acquittal on the charge of insanity. The young man
still had some means left, and gathering everything
together, he sailed for foreign shores with Berry, having
first instructed a lawyer to attend to the rights of
his inheritance from his mother when the property
was divided, on his sister’s coming of age.</p>

<p>That was long ago, and many things had transpired
in that time.</p>

<p>To begin with, the disinherited son, never used to
economy before, had recklessly spent the funds he had
in hand, traveling expensively, showing Berry the wonders<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
of the Old World, and answering to her timid
remonstrances on his extravagance that he had plenty
to last six months, and by then Marie would come of
age and he would get his portion of five hundred thousand
dollars from his mother.</p>

<p>And, oh, the days, the weeks, the months, how happily
they had gone to the young pair of married lovers!</p>

<p>They had done the Continent leisurely at their own
sweet will, they had wandered hither and thither with
not a care save the silent grief of the young husband
over the estrangement from his own people, and as to
Berry, she had found out long ago, by a cablegram,
that her mother was still living, not dead, as the vile
fortune teller had falsely declared.</p>

<p>On getting this news the young husband had
promptly sent his mother-in-law a sum of money sufficient
to keep her in ease and comfort a year, so that
Berry’s heart was at ease, and she gave herself up
wholly to her happiness. They adored each other with
a true devotion that never grew less. They were all
in all to each other:</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p>Whatever the carping world might say of the millionaire<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
senator’s only son’s mésalliance, to him it had
been a salvation, turning him from evil courses to a
purer, better life, making out of him the noble man
nature had intended him to be.</p>

<p>His lovely bride grew more charming every day, to
his enraptured eyes, and he bitterly regretted the pride
that had prevented his family from seeing and knowing
the girl whose flawless beauty and simple goodness
must, if permitted the opportunity, have won its
way to every heart.</p>

<p>He grew hot and angry when he remembered how
bitterly they had railed against his darling, saying to
himself that it was not like them to be so harsh and
unforgiving, and it was surely Rosalind who had set
them onto such cruelty, for she had threatened him
with dire vengeance, and this was how she had kept her
word. Once he had pitied Rosalind, but now he hated
her for her malice that had cost him so dear.</p>

<p>He got another taste of it when the time rolled
around for the division of his mother’s fortune, for
his lawyer wrote him that Senator Bonair, as sole
trustee, refused to surrender his son’s portion, still
claiming he was insane and unfit to have the use of
the money.</p>

<p>Then it was Bonair’s wrath waved high.</p>

<p>“Berry, darling, will you excuse me if I go out and<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
swear a little outdoors? Oh, yes, I know I promised
you never to swear again, but a reformed man must
relapse at times, you know, and really this seems to
me an occasion for profuse profanity!” he said grimly,
to the beautiful creature who smiled tenderly at him
and answered:</p>

<p>“But do not stay out long, dearest, or I will not
forgive you breaking your promise to me.”</p>

<p>He was not absent very long, and when he returned,
he said:</p>

<p>“On second thought I didn’t swear at all; I wrote my
lawyer to bring suit against my father at once for the
payment of my money.”</p>

<p>“Do not worry over it, dear. We have each other,
and are happy as we are,” Berry answered, with a
coaxing smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we are happy as we are, but our money
will not last much longer, little one, and you have
not been well lately, and we will need a lot of money
for that sweet secret you whispered to me yesterday,”
the young man answered, with a new, dignified gravity
very becoming.</p>

<p>Berry’s lovely color deepened, and the glance of her
brown eyes was simply adorable.</p>

<p>“But you know we must not travel about, now,”
she murmured. “We must settle down and live quietly<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
until June, you know, as the doctor said, so it will not
take so much money to live as when we are always on
the wing. We can take a tiny little house or a little
suite of rooms, and keep house with one maid, don’t
you see; or if we cannot afford the maid, why, I can
do the cooking myself, you see. Do you know I can
make tea and toast, and broil steak, and serve eggs
in most any fashion, sir?” she added smilingly.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it, but we need not come
to that. I think we can have the little suite of rooms
and the maid of all work. My lawyer will be glad
enough to furnish me the means of subsistence while
he is prosecuting my suit,” the young husband answered
confidently.</p>

<p>The plan was carried out, and by Berry’s wish they
made their little home in London, for she was tired,
she said, of the foreign lingo she couldn’t understand,
and wanted to stay among people who spoke her mother
tongue.</p>

<p>So they came from France and Italy, where they
had passed the winter months, to London, where, in a
comfortable but not luxurious suite of rooms, with
a buxom maid of all work, they lived quietly and
happily until May. Berenice devoted her time of seclusion
in studying the languages under the tutorship
of Charley, who was quite proficient in that line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>Thus quietly and happily they waited an event that
was to crown their wedded lives with happiness.</p>

<p>Alas! fortune frowned on their springing hopes.
Their little baby died, soon after birth, and was laid
tenderly away in a wee green grave. But for over six
weeks, a battle of physicians went on, with grim death
in the foreground, trying to snatch Berry from their
fostering care.</p>

<p>Never till now did Charley Bonair realize the depth
and strength of his love for his precious wife. Sharing
the vigils of the doctors and nurses with ceaseless
care, he grew to feel to his heart’s core all that she
was to him, and knew that if she died, life would be unendurable
to him forever after.</p>

<p>Oh, what joy when the wavering balance of life and
death dropped her into her husband’s arms again, with
the chances in her favor for recovery!</p>

<p>While she lay so ill, he had learned to pray, this man
who had almost forgotten his God, and now he sent
up a prayer of thanksgiving for her restoration.</p>

<p>While she was slowly convalescing, the head physician
ordered that Mrs. Bonair should be taken, as soon
as she was able to be moved, down to the sea, naming
an obscure and rude little fishing village on the
coast of Cornwall as the preferred situation.</p>

<p>“She will have absolute calm and quiet there, and<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
it is very essential to her shattered nerves and frail
condition of health,” he said.</p>

<p>“We shall be buried alive,” Charley said grimly to
his wife when he took her there, but she answered, with
her usual sunny good nature:</p>

<p>“At least we shall be buried in the same grave, so
I am content.”</p>

<p>“And I,” he answered as happily.</p>

<p>Thus we find them, in late August, by the sea, where
Berry recovered her health and spirits again, and so
in love with the free, wild life of the unconventional
village of hardy fisher folk that both were loath to
leave. So they lingered on, from day to day, saying “it
is so pleasant staying, and so cheap living, we will not
go away until we get news from California of the success
of the suit for his mother’s fortune.”</p>

<p>Since she grew well and strong again, Berry had
taken up her studies with zest, by Charley’s wish,
trying to make herself equal in education to any position
she might be called on to fill in the future.</p>

<p>For she knew now that, dearly as he loved her,
there was a silent ache in his warm heart for those who
cast him off in anger, and that he hoped against hope
for a reconciliation at some future day when his
bride’s true worth and beauty shall be known and
acknowledged.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TURN OF THE TIDE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The lawsuit had dragged on interminably for six
months, and it seemed as if a decision would never
be reached, so that Charley was getting very poor,
indeed, and very impatient, although, to tell the truth,
he was finding that love in a cottage was very charming,
after all, as there were funds enough coming from
his lawyer still to keep the young pair in bread and
cheese and a little more.</p>

<p>In the meantime Charley’s two beautiful sisters
had both married in June, and the newspapers on both
sides of the Atlantic had duly chronicled the grand
double wedding at Bonair, when Marie and Lucile had
wedded the rich New Yorkers to whom they had been
betrothed before Charley’s mad marriage. They had
crossed the Atlantic on their wedding tour and were
now in Switzerland. Along with reports of the wedding
was an item that made Charley throw down the
paper he was reading, with a sigh from the bottom
of his heart.</p>

<p>“Hello, Berry, we are in hard luck now, to be sure!
Dad will never be reconciled to us now, never! He
is going to give me Rosalind for a stepmother!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>Berry was lounging on the sands in an old blue boating
suit, her hat lying at her feet and her curly hair
blowing about her tanned face and rosy cheeks that
suddenly grew pale, as she turned a solemn pair of
eyes on his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no, he must not!” she exclaimed vehemently.</p>

<p>Charley Bonair gave a curt, angry laugh, replying:</p>

<p>“Easy enough to say, but how are we going to prevent
it, pray?”</p>

<p>“Yes, how, indeed?” Berry answered, turning a
troubled gaze back to the sea, with the white caps
rolling in, the seagulls flitting about with their strange
cries. She had no more to say, and Charley picked up
the paper again and said:</p>

<p>“The engagement has been authoritatively announced,
and my silly old dad has commenced the
erection of a palace in Washington where she will reign
a queen at the next session of Congress. Isn’t it a
burning shame?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;she is not worthy of your father, if he is as
good and kind as you say he is in spite of his injustice
to you,” Berry replied, with palpable chagrin, her
brooding brown eyes still upon the sea as it gleamed
in the morning sunshine, fairly dazzling her sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p>The young man frowned and sighed, then burst
out frankly:</p>

<p>“It’s true all I said of him, Berry, darling. He used
to be just the dearest dad in the world, kind, loving,
and indulgent to a fault, and so were my pretty sisters,
too; and I never dreamed they could turn against me
in the way they did, and hold out spiteful all this time.
But I see how it is now! It’s that scheming Rosalind
setting them on, determined to get the Bonair
millions for herself, either through the father or the
son. Her mercenary spirit and her thirst for revenge
have led her on to this, and poor dad has been like wax
in her clever hands, so she has molded him to her
will. Berry, I always heard that a handsome woman
could make a fool of the smartest old man, and now
I see it’s true. It’s flattered vanity, that’s what it is,
or an old man might always see that no pretty young
woman loves him for himself alone. It’s always for
some cash he has in hand! Oh, Berry, why did you
make me swear off on profanity? Surely this is an
occasion for it!” he groaned.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t Charley, dear! It would not help things
any,” she answered gently.</p>

<p>“At least it would relieve my feelings,” he answered
ruefully, adding whimsically:</p>

<p>“Say, Berry, see that old fisherman tacking in to<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
shore, below there? Black Dobbins they call him, and
he is the most picturesque swearer you ever heard
of on the Cornwall coast. Say, I’ll go down there and
give him a crown to swear a blue streak of lightning
for me. Don’t you listen, darling, unless you want to
have that creepy feeling running down your spine.”</p>

<p>He strolled away, but before he got to Black Dobbins,
Berry called after him hastily:</p>

<p>“Oh, Charley, come back! You didn’t notice the
letters with your mail; you were so angry over the
news. Here’s a letter from your lawyer in California,
and another from those dear, good Clines.”</p>

<p>“Read them while I attend to business,” he returned,
keeping on, and saying to the fisherman:</p>

<p>“What luck, Dobbins?”</p>

<p>The net was nearly empty, and Dobbins replied
with a string of appalling oaths to which Charley listened
with perfect complaisance, after which he threw
the angry fisherman a silver crown, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Those are precisely my sentiments, Dobbins. Accept
this token of my appreciation!”</p>

<p>While the man gaped in amazement, he laughed
again and turned on his heel, going back to his wife.</p>

<p>“I feel better! That fellow comforted me. He
swore at his ill luck and I applied all the ‘swear words’<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
to Rosalind, and paid him a crown,” he said drolly.
“Ah, my dear, you look brighter! Any luck?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Charley, Charley!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Berry, Berry!”</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh at me, you dear old silly! I can
hardly find words to tell you, but&mdash;but”&mdash;radiantly&mdash;“our
luck has turned at last, Charley. You have won!”</p>

<p>She flung herself, tumultuously, into his arms, regardless
of Black Dobbins, gazing curiously from a
distance, and joyfully fingering the generous crown,
and Charley hugged her tight, crying:</p>

<p>“Hurrah! hurrah! Five hundred thousand dollars
for you and me, little lovey-dovey, and now you shall
be a little queen! I shall deck you out in silks and
laces and diamonds, and buy you an automobile, sure;
and we shall be as happy as the day is long!”</p>

<p>“We are happy as that now, and we could not be
any happier if we had all your father’s millions. All
we wish is his good will,” Berry answered seriously;
then drawing back from his embrace, she added:</p>

<p>“That old man is staring at us; perhaps thinking
we have gone suddenly mad! Sit down and read your
letter like a dignified, married man, now.”</p>

<p>He obeyed, and found that all she had said was true.</p>

<p>The suit was won. His father’s lawyers had given
up and the case was definitely closed. Senator Bonair<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
indeed had sailed for Europe some time previous,
and perhaps his son had seen him somewhere before
this. He hoped, fervently, that they might meet and
make up their quarrel before the consummation of the
senator’s reported engagement to the beautiful belle,
Miss Montague. Otherwise it was certain, in the event
of the marriage, that Charley would never get a
dollar of his father’s money.</p>

<p>“Dear old dad, it is not his money as much as his
good will that I covet!” cried the young man, adding:</p>

<p>“Ah, Berry, how glorious it would be to have you
in Washington next winter, queening it over my
father’s new house instead of hateful Rosalind. You
are so lovely, so winning, I predict you would carry
society by storm.”</p>

<p>“There’s no danger of my ever having an opportunity
to do so, but so long as I can queen it over
your heart I do not care,” she answered lightly, though
her heart beat high at his words of praise.</p>

<p>She was only a woman, after all, and she longed
to show Charley’s proud relations that she was worthy
of his love, and that she had made a better man of him
by her tenderness; but it could never be. They would
never forget she was born in a lowly cot, wreathed
in morning glories, instead of a lordly castle. She
would not have cared so much only she would like to<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
win their favor for Charley’s sake, because it would
make him so happy.</p>

<p>She turned to the letter from the Clines, who were
doing well in another place in California, and who related
the news of the double marriage and reported
engagement, as they had just read in the newspaper,
and closed with their dear love and respect to Mr.
Charley and his bonnie wife.</p>

<p>And now the young husband began eagerly, with
shining eyes:</p>

<p>“It is more than likely father will be in London,
now. Oh, Berry, what if we go up there and try for
a reconciliation? Perhaps his heart may have melted
by now.”</p>

<p>“Dearest, do you remember what the doctor said?
I must not go away from the sea till the last of September.
But although I cannot go with you, there is
nothing to hinder your going alone. I can stay here
with the maid till you come back to me. See, I will not
be selfish. Although I came between you and your
father’s heart, my dearest wish is to see you friends
again, even though he should never speak to me. Oh,
go, go, my dearest love, and try to make your peace
with him!”</p>

<p>“Darling little angel, I will take you at your word,
for my heart yearns to my silly old dad, that’s a fact,”<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
he cried eagerly, and before night he was en route for
London, leaving Berry at the cottage alone with the
buxom maid, who, to dry her mistress’ tears, immediately
proceeded to retail all the news of the village.</p>

<p>Had she heard about the grand, rich gentleman up
at the inn, in the hollow, who had sickened with smallpox
the very day he arrived, and was lying at death’s
door up there without a nurse or a doctor, for everybody
had fled the pestilence in alarm, and there was no
one to care for him but the valet, who cursed the cowards,
and was waiting on his master all by himself,
doing the best he could, promising loads of money for
help, but no one would believe his tale of riches, or
that <a id="Ref_186" href="#BRef_186">his master was</a> an American lord, standing up close
to the very president himself. His name? It was
Bonny Hair or Bonny Air, or something very like it.</p>

</div>


<p>The loquacious maid who had been pouring out
her story without a single period, now paused for
breath, and Berry stared at her with wide, wondering
brown eyes.</p>

<p>The name of the sick American, as rendered by the
maid, caught her instant attention.</p>

<p>“Bonny Hair, or Bonny Air&mdash;something like that,”
said the maid, and how like it sounded the name of
Bonair.</p>

<p>A quick suspicion stirred Berry’s mind into agitation.</p>

<p>“Why, it might be Charley’s own dear father lying
there ill, and deserted by the stupid, fearsome fisher
folk, helpless, for all of his millions, to secure a nurse!”</p>

<p>Her brown eyes flashed, and she rose up hastily.</p>

<p>“Hannah, I’m an American, too, and I’m going up
there to nurse the old man. I cannot let my fellow
countryman die for lack of a friend.”</p>

<p>“But, oh, my dear mistress, it’s that terrible smallpox.
You wouldn’t dare! You would catch it and
die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>“No, Hannah, I’m immune. I had the disease years
ago, way back in my old New Jersey home, and am
not even pitted, you see, save two deep scars where it
does not show. So I shall go, and at once, leaving you
to care for the home till I return.”</p>

<p>With Berry to make up her mind was to act. She
dressed herself simply and comfortably, and packed a
suit case with necessary clothing, after which she went
to a drug store and made some purchases. After
leaving a letter for Charley, she hired the nearest conveyance
to take her to the inn where she meant to
take up the part of a good Samaritan.</p>

<p>The driver was so frightened when he saw the yellow
flag waving from the gate of the inn that he refused
to go within a square of the house, and she
paid him and walked the rest of the way, with her
luggage and her bundles.</p>

<p>How lonely and deserted looked the weather-beaten
old inn with the doors tight shut and the curtains
down, as if death already brooded over the house.</p>

<p>Berry pulled the knocker several times, loudly, before
she had any response, and then the valet, unkempt
and unshorn, himself answered the door and gazed in
surprise at the beautiful girl standing expectant with
her luggage at her feet.</p>

<p>He bowed, then stammered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, miss, you had better go right away. Didn’t
you see that yellow flag at the gate? There’s a case of
smallpox in the house, and no travelers are taken in
now.”</p>

<p>“Where is the landlord?” she asked, and the man
answered furiously:</p>

<p>“The cowardly rascal ran away, with his servants,
and left me alone here with my sick master; and although
the fellow promised to send me a nurse or doctor,
or both, not a hair have I seen of either yet, and
here I am with Senator Bonair on my hands, ill as he
can be, and I daren’t leave him to hunt for any one
to help me; and even if I went they would shun me
like a wild beast, fearing the contagion. It’s a burning
shame, so it is; but I’ll not run away like a coward,
though, belike, I’ll be taking the disease myself and
dying of it, too.”</p>

<p>His mouth flew wide open as Berry said calmly:</p>

<p>“I am the nurse for Senator Bonair, and I shall vaccinate
you at once&mdash;what is your name?”</p>

<p>“John Tousey, please, miss.”</p>

<p>“Very well, John; take my luggage to a comfortable
room, please. And the next thing will be to vaccinate
you so that if you should contract the disease
you will only have it in a light form. I came prepared
for this,” and making him bare his arm she took<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
a lancet, scratching a small spot on it, with outward
nerve and inward quaking, feeling, when the blood was
drawn, that queer sickness that presages fainting.
Overcoming the weakness with a strong effort of will,
she duly used her vaccine point, much to the man’s relief,
for his countenance brightened, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Bless you, miss! I’m so glad you came, and I
hope this will save me from that awful scourge. I
began to think the old landlord lied, when he said
that he’d send us the nurse and doctor.”</p>

<p>“I was told at the drug store that the doctor was
ill himself, so there was none to come but me,” the
nurse replied, adding:</p>

<p>“But I know how to treat the case very well myself,
as the disease ran through my own family once,
and there’s more in the nursing than the medicine, so
lead me to your master and we’ll see what is to be
done.”</p>

<p>With joyful alacrity, the man preceded her to the
darkened room where lay her millionaire father-in-law
in the terrible plight of a smallpox patient at
the worst stage, without benefit of doctor or skillful
nurse.</p>

<p>Berenice took hold of everything with an ease that
fairly charmed John Tousey, evolving comfort out of<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
chaos, and soon making the sick man more comfortable
in every way.</p>

<p>The larder was well filled, so that, although isolated
from their kind, they were in no danger of starving.
Berry took up her burden with a cheerful heart,
thinking:</p>

<p>“Although Senator Bonair may despise me for being
a poor cottage girl, it is well for him now that I am
skilled in homely accomplishments, that I may minister
the better to his needs.”</p>

<p>She wondered, as she went busily about her work,
when Charley would return and what he would think
of the task she had undertaken. He would be disappointed
at finding her gone, but he could not blame
her, could not think she was in the wrong.</p>

<p>She had written to him sweetly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have isolated myself from you for a time, my
dearest love, but when I tell you why I am sure you
will be glad for me to do this act of kindness.</p>

<p>“I heard that a man who must surely, from his name,
be your own father, was up at the inn, very low with
smallpox, and that every one but his valet had deserted
the poor man, and he was likely to die without doctor
or nurse, so I thought it was my plain duty to come
and nurse him.</p>

<p>“There is no danger for me, you know, because I
have had the disease, and I also know how to treat<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
it, so do not worry over me, but go and get vaccinated
as soon as you can and try and get some good
doctor to come and see the patient.</p>

<p>“Dearest, try to rest easy. You can hear from me
every day this way. I will wave a white flag from the
window every day at noon. That will mean all is
going on right. Be patient, I will do all I can for the
dad you love so well.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A GENEROUS OFFER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Poor Charley, returning next day from London, depressed
and discouraged at not seeing his father, was
dazed to find his sweet wife gone, and to get her letter
of explanation.</p>

<p>But after the first shock of surprise, and trouble, his
warm heart thrilled with joy and pride at her noble
deed.</p>

<p>“Father cannot help but forgive us now if she should
save his life, dear girl, for when once he knows her
how could he resist her grace and beauty?” he said,
over and over, to himself hopefully, for the yearning
for reunion with his kindred was strong within him.</p>

<p>“Rosalind is at the bottom of it all. If I could but
break her influence, all might be well again; but she
is posing as injured innocence and beauty, and hardening
their hearts against me for her sake,” he thought,
with impatient resentment. Then he put it from him
to write a long letter to Berry&mdash;a real love letter,
full of praise and tenderness, which he went and slipped
under the front door of the inn that night.</p>

<p>She very soon found it, and smiled to herself as she<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
appropriated the sealed envelope addressed simply to
“The Lady Nurse.”</p>

<p>Hurrying to her tidy little room, she read the loving
contents and kissed the letter over and over, hiding
it next her heart, while she returned to her duties by
the sick man, who was very ill indeed, with his eyes
quite shut so that he could not see the vision of beauty
and tenderness that bent over him. But not so wholly
unconscious that he could not feel the balm of healing
carried by the soft white hands that touched him so
gently. He knew, dimly, by her gentle ministrations
and the improved food, that the valet now had efficient
aid. And that was enough, in his feverish state,
to soothe his mind.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours came the physician engaged
by Charley. Though he shook his head over the
gravity of the case, he approved all that Berenice
had done, and desired her to continue at her post.</p>

<p>So the days came and went and the disease ran its
course quickly, while John Tousey also came down with
a light case, so that the physician recommended another
nurse, an elderly woman, who took second place
to Berry in the conduct of the invalids.</p>

<p>Charley had taken the young physician frankly into
his confidence, telling him to safeguard his young
wife’s health very carefully, and by him he sent her<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
daily letters of love and cheer, telling her how he
missed her, and of the pride he felt in her noble
mission.</p>

<p>But, ah, how they missed each other, the loving
pair; how slowly the weeks of absence went, and how
happy the day when Doctor Perry said to the lonely
husband:</p>

<p>“My patients are convalescing fast. The valet is
going to sit up to-day, and to-morrow the senator will
be allowed to sit up for an hour or two. He is quite
out of danger, and I am going to tell your wife she
may leave him to-morrow and come home. I am not
sure the patient will like it, for he is devoted to her
and impatient of the elderly woman, but he will have
to bear it.”</p>

<p>He was right, for when the senator was told next
day that Miss Brown, as they called her, was going to
leave him, he protested vigorously; said he could not
spare her yet; he needed her to read and talk to him,
and was willing to pay any price to have her stay on
even one week longer. Why, his eyes had only got
strong now to see how lovely and charming she was,
and he needed some one pleasant to look at since he
could not have his daughters, who were both on their
bridal tours, and to whom he had not allowed any
message of his illness to be sent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“But you have a son, sir?” interrogated Doctor
Perry.</p>

<p>The invalid’s face gloomed over, and he answered
curtly:</p>

<p>“I had a son, sir, but he died to me when he disgraced
his family by jilting the sweet young girl to
whom he was betrothed, and wedding a low-born,
scheming actress.”</p>

<p>He did not hear a low, soft sigh outside the half-open
door, for Doctor Perry said, with apparent surprise:</p>

<p>“You astonish me, sir, for we English have been led
to believe that in your favored land of America you
raise no barriers against marriage with those of inferior
birth or fortunes.”</p>

<p>The senator answered testily:</p>

<p>“We raise no barriers against true worth, Doctor
Perry. I myself am a self-made man, risen from poverty,
and not ashamed of it. But you have heard that
circumstances alter cases? Well, let me explain. My
son’s offense had not been so unpardonable had he been
free to choose the girl he wed, but when he took the
marriage vow he dishonored himself and his family because
he was already pledged to another, a girl whose
heart was almost broken by his falsity.”</p>

<p>“Yet rumor says that she is already consoled by a<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
promise of your hand, sir,” the young physician ventured.</p>

<p>Senator Bonair’s face already reddened by his illness,
flushed deeper as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You seem well posted on my affairs, sir.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but no offense was meant, my
dear senator. Surely you know that the affairs of so
eminent a person as yourself are public property. All
I have spoken of to you I have read in the London
newspapers, but perhaps I should not have ventured
to discuss them with you.”</p>

<p>“You might choose pleasanter subjects,” the senator
answered quickly. “For instance, my pretty young
nurse whom we were discussing just now, and to whom
Tousey says I really owe my life, coming to me as she
did when I was in the worst stages of my illness.”</p>

<p>“Tousey tells the truth. You could hardly have
lived a day longer without her kindly ministrations at
the time she came to you. But the time has come when,
for the sake of her own health, she must forsake you
and go home to rest.”</p>

<p>“Ah, she is tired, broken-down&mdash;you mean that?”</p>

<p>“Somewhat that way, for Miss Brown herself has
had a serious illness this summer, and that explains
why she was found in this rude village where she remains<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
to strengthen her health. I hardly believe it
safe for her to remain another week in attendance
on you. But here she comes,” as a light step crossed
the threshold, “and I will let her speak for herself.”</p>

<p>Berenice entered, graceful as a young princess in her
snowy white gown and becoming nurse’s cap, and she
gave the doctor a roguish smile that plainly said:</p>

<p>“I’ve been eavesdropping, but, of course, you knew
that I was there.”</p>

<p>He smiled back at her and retired, leaving her
alone with the patient, who, in his dressing gown, lay
back at ease in his reclining chair, watching with admiring
eyes every movement of his fair nurse.</p>

<p>Berry sat down close to him and looked, shyly, into
his face, trying to appear at ease, though her poor heart
thumped wildly against her side, and the fitful color
came and went, like a flag of distress, in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are getting on fast, sir!” she cried, with a
slight tremor in her musical voice. “Your eyes seem
quite strong to-day, and that blistering red skin is getting
fairer. How fortunate, too, that you will only be
pitted very slightly, and if I could but have come to
you a little sooner you need not have carried a single
scar.”</p>

<p>“You came in time to save my life, dear child, that<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
was enough,” replied the great man, so kindly that it
emboldened Berenice to exclaim:</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I was to serve you, sir! I can never
make you realize it. It is sweet to save a life so valuable
to the world and to so many friends who love
you.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her gratefully.</p>

<p>“Among those latter friends, please let me have the
pleasure of counting you, henceforth, Miss Brown,”
he answered. “In my gratitude to you for all you have
done for me in this terrible illness, I look upon you
almost as a daughter, and am eager to advance your interests
in any way most pleasing to you. Our good
doctor has just told me that you must leave me soon,
to my great regret. But, as he puts it, on the score of
your health, I dare not protest against my ill fortune
in losing you, just as we begin to know each other
well.”</p>

<p>“Your words make me very, very happy,” she
sweetly said, “but do not think that I intend to desert
you altogether, for I shall remain in the village a while
longer, and I will come and see you every day, if you
will let me.”</p>

<p>“I shall be only too glad to have you come whenever
you will, my dear young lady, and I wish you to understand<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
that I take a deep interest in you and am
anxious to reward you beyond your mere salary for all
you have done for me. Tell me frankly, Miss Brown,
if there is any great favor, financial or otherwise, I can
do for you?”</p>

</div>


<p>Berenice was so overwhelmed with joyous excitement
that the tears rushed in a torrent to her eyes, and
she half sobbed:</p>

<p>“Ah, you could do much for me if you would&mdash;but&mdash;I
fear to ask.”</p>

<p>“Only try me, dear girl; only name your wishes and
see. If you need money, and very likely you do in your
position, I am very rich and surely the saving of my life
is worth a little fortune to me. Come, dry your tears
and let me make you happy. I shall write you a check
for five thousand dollars. That is little enough for
all I owe you, too little! Will that please you?”</p>

<p>She flung out her white hands convulsively, sobbing:</p>

<p>“No, no, no&mdash;not a penny! I am not rich, but a fortune
is not what I crave. There is something dearer,
dearer!”</p>

<p>“What else, child, speak? What other favor can I
do for you?” the senator asked, in growing wonder.</p>

<p>He was more amazed than ever when the white-gowned
figure knelt, humbly, at his feet, with little,
upraised, beseeching hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>Berenice pleaded, wildly, through raining tears:</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, there is one who loves you dearly, one
whom you used to love, but your heart is turned against
him and he is in bitter sorrow for your anger. It was I
who unwittingly came between you, and if I have done
aught to merit your favor, the reward I ask is not
for myself but him&mdash;only this, forgive him, take him
back to your heart!”</p>

<p>There was an awful silence.</p>

<p>Senator Bonair sat still, growing deadly pale through
his florid color, like a statue stiffening into stone, his
eyes fixed, sternly, on the beautiful, kneeling suppliant.</p>

<p>“Who are you, then, if not Miss Brown?” he asked,
in a hard, cold voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you know already, sir? Have you not
guessed?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Are you my&mdash;I mean Charley Bonair’s wife?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, yes&mdash;I am his wife, the little actress you
hate because she rivaled proud, rich Rosalind,” she confessed.
“Must I go now, must I go?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. Wait and tell me if this was a plot to
creep back into favor for the sake of my fortune? Did
Charley send you here to nurse me so devotedly that I
could deny you nothing?” The tone was harsh and
grating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>Berenice, still kneeling, put up her small hands as if
to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>“Ah, cruel, cruel!” she moaned. Then bitterly:
“How could you think your son so low? Did he show
a mercenary spirit when he married poor little Berry
Vining? Oh, may I tell you all about it? Will you
listen fairly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will listen, but stop crying first and get up
and sit in this chair close by, while you tell me how
it happened.”</p>

<p>Berenice, looking adorably pretty and pitiful, obeyed
him, and after drying her wet eyes again, said patiently:</p>

<p>“It was this way, sir: Just as I tell you, Charley
loved all of you dearly and grieved over the separation,
not for your money’s worth, but for true love’s
sake. So that day when he read you were in England,
he said he would go and find you and beg your forgiveness.
But I&mdash;I&mdash;was timid and afraid of you, so I
stayed here. I refused to go. When he was gone I
was lonely, and the maid told me of the desperate
case of the sick man up here, with no doctor or nurse,
so I thought it must be you and I came to you, asking
no one’s leave because I knew when Charley should
come back he would feel I had only done my duty coming
here to succor his dear father. And I was right,<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
for so he said in his letters afterward. Oh, sir, we
are not after your money, we only want your pardon&mdash;for
him, if not for me, poor Charley! Because he
loves you so! As for me, I have done very little, really,
for there was no risk nursing you since I had already
had the disease years ago. I&mdash;I&mdash;might never have
told you who I was, or claimed any favor, only that
you bade me to, and then my heart leaped at the
thought of my husband. Oh, cannot you understand?”
She broke down and hid her lovely face in her dimpled
hands.</p>

<p>Her dazed father-in-law sat watching her, noting her
wonderful grace and charm, recalling what his son had
said to him the day of their bitter quarrel.</p>

<p>In his weakness and loneliness, the old love, smothered
under anger, seemed to surge upward again and
flood his whole being with tenderness for his son.
But he called pride to his aid, lest she should see too
quickly, this lovely suppliant, how the ice was melting
around his heart.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, and his voice sounded stern and
harsh in her ears, “tell me all about yourself and Charley&mdash;how
you first met, how love grew between you
until he forgot his troth to Rosalind. Begin at the
beginning; leave nothing unsaid.”</p>

<p>Berenice obeyed, nothing loath, for it pleased her to<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
recall everything connected with Charley, and she left
nothing untold from the hour of their first meeting
until now.</p>

<p>Senator Bonair, resting easily, with half-closed eyes,
did not miss a word of her story, nor an expression
of her radiant face that glowed with happy blushes
as she told her tale of love.</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, and turning to her as she ended
her story, remarked:</p>

<p>“It would make a pretty novel, this love story of
yours and Charley’s, and I should not have found much
fault with it if Rosalind had been left out of it, but
her wrongs made me indignant, caused all my bitterest
anger against you both.”</p>

<p>“It was sad,” replied Berenice, “that she should suffer
for our happiness&mdash;very hard. But it was better
for Charley to tell her the truth frankly, as he did,
and ask for his release.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree with you on the latter point, but Rosalind
denies that Charley ever asked for a release. She
claims that she was betrothed to him all the while, and
her mortification was so extreme that to palliate my
son’s offense I&mdash;&mdash;” he paused and bit his lips, but
Berenice finished the sentence for him:</p>

<p>“You threw yourself into the breach, with your high
sense of honor, and offered to heal the wound by<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
marrying her yourself, thus still making her prospective
heiress of the Bonair millions, the high stakes for
which she was playing.”</p>

<p>He quickly took up the cudgel in Rosalind’s defense.</p>

<p>“Hush! she is not mercenary. I am sure she loved
my son dearly, and can never give me but a tame affection.
If I believed Rosalind unworthy of my respect
and love, I could sooner forgive my son’s perfidy. For
I must own you are a very charming little lady!” exclaimed
the senator frankly.</p>

<p>She smiled up at him gratefully.</p>

<p>“Not little lady&mdash;little daughter,” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“Little daughter, then,” he amended smilingly, and
felt his heart thrill warmly at the word.</p>

<p>“I thank you a hundred times!” she cried, blushing
with joy, and adding: “Now I know you will forgive
Charley and call him son.”</p>

<p>He answered gravely:</p>

<p>“Do you think if I will forgive him and receive him
again he will be content with that? For you know I
have disinherited him out of justice to Rosalind, whom
I am to marry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, if you marry Rosalind, Charley will not
strive for the miserable money. We have been happy
without it for more than a year. But&mdash;but&mdash;I prophesy
that you will never marry Rosalind, because you<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
will learn, before it is too late, that she is unworthy of
you!”</p>

<p>He frowned, and said:</p>

<p>“Nay, you have already wronged Rosalind enough;
let her name rest. She will surely be my bride.”</p>

<p>Berenice sighed and held out her hand, replying:</p>

<p>“If I believed that, I should be very sorry for you,
sir. But I must be going now. My poor boy is
wearying for me this long time. Tell me, do you forgive
him? May he come to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“He may come to-day. I am too impatient to wait,”
the senator cried, with a sudden outburst of tenderness.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN OLD FOOL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>September slipped into October and Miss Montague
returned home again from Bar Harbor, where she
spent the summer.</p>

<p>Up at the hall it was very gay, for she was entertaining
a house party of her friends, to all of whom
it was well known that her trousseau was being made
ready, and that before Christmas she was to be married
to the multimillionaire, Senator Bonair.</p>

<p>But latterly Rosalind, although outwardly gay, was
inwardly disturbed and uneasy, for in nearly two
months she had no letter from her elderly betrothed,
and became alarmed lest he should slip through her
fingers.</p>

<p>In the absence of her betrothed she had consoled
herself by flirting, in which she was an adept, and
managed, on the whole, to pass away time very pleasantly.</p>

<p>There was one man who had danced attendance on
her all summer, a handsome, dark-eyed, jealous fellow,
that she preferred to any other, and she said to
herself that she would keep him dangling on, till the<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
senator came home, then, she would have to dismiss
him for good. He was desperately in earnest, she
knew, and she sometimes shuddered, wondering what
he would do when he was given his congé. She would
not be surprised in the least if he committed suicide;
but if he chose to be such a fool, how could she help it?</p>

<p>Now that October was nearing its end, a vague uneasiness
began to possess her, for it was quite two
months since Senator Bonair had written, and she wondered
at his strange silence, and that he did not return
home.</p>

<p>Of the two daughters who had gone abroad on a
bridal tour around the world, she also heard nothing.
The silence was puzzling, annoying. Not even the
ubiquitous newspapers seemed to know anything of the
great man’s whereabouts.</p>

<p>“It looks bad, and I do not know what to make of
it,” she said to her mother uneasily.</p>

<p>“Have you written him?”</p>

<p>“Several times, and as the letters are not returned
he must have received them, so his silence is hard to
understand.”</p>

<p>“It is very hard, indeed, for an old lover is mostly
a greater fool than a young one,” said the worldly-wise
mother. “Now, the senator acts so indifferently
that he is quite puzzling. I expected he would write<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
to you by every mail, and fairly load you with costly
gifts, but he seems to almost forget your existence,
and as for gifts, you have received nothing but your
diamond engagement ring, and that handsome pearl
necklace. If I were you, Rosalind, I would call him
to time!”</p>

<p>“What could you do, mamma, since he does not answer
my letters, and I cannot follow him up, not
knowing whither he has gone?” Rosalind cried impatiently.</p>

<p>“I would write him again&mdash;a real love letter, pleading
and reproachful by turns, insisting on an answer.
Make him show his hand, whatever he has got up his
sleeve,” exclaimed Mrs. Montague, rather coarsely.</p>

<p>“Faugh! the idea of writing a love letter to that
gray-haired man, sixty years old!” pouted Rosalind
disdainfully.</p>

<p>“You will have to pass a long life with him, remember,
and he will expect love-making from you, too,
which is worse than writing a love letter,” reminded
Mrs. Montague.</p>

<p>“A long life with that old dotard! No, no, don’t
you fancy such a silly thing as that, mamma! When
I get him I shall lead him such a dance I shall soon
worry him into his grave.” Rosalind laughed heartlessly,
much to the displeasure of her mother, who,<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
though worldly-wise and scheming, was not so cruel by
nature. She proceeded to read Rosalind a lecture on
the duty to the man she should marry, all of which
was heard with a rosy face, and interrupted before
its end by the exclamation:</p>

<p>“Oh, bother! don’t lecture me! I shall do as I please
with my doting old spouse!”</p>

<p>“There’s another thing, my dear, and that is, I think
you go too far flirting with this Adrian Vance. We
really do not know much about him, who he is, or why
he seems so devoted to you. They say he comes of very
humble origin, and certainly he is poor enough! You
are making him desperate with love of you. You
should send him away.”</p>

<p>“I shall do no such thing. I intend to keep him
dangling on, to flirt with after I have married old Sir
Moneybags!” Rosalind laughed, with an insolence that
brooked no further interference.</p>

<p>But she was not quite a fool, this scheming beauty,
so she heeded her mother’s advice enough to write such
a letter as she advised, and she waited impatiently
enough for an answer, for although she did not love
the old man, she dearly loved the moneybags she talked
of so glibly, and also her revenge on Charley Bonair.</p>

<p>To her surprise and relief, the fond love letter
brought a prompt reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>Senator Bonair had been too ill to write to any one,
and not wishing to alarm his daughters or his betrothed,
had not suffered any one else to write to them
of his illness.</p>

<p>Therefore, although he had had her letters forwarded
from London down to the village, he had not
troubled himself to reply; and now that he was better
he had a weakness of the eyes so that the doctor forbade
him to use the pen.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, he had recourse, of all people in the
world, to his son, to act as his amanuensis.</p>

<p>The father and son were on excellent terms now, and
the young couple had taken up their quarters at the inn
at his urgent request, to help while away the dull hours
until he was well enough to go.</p>

<p>“Here, Berry, you write the letter for father to his
sweetheart!” cried Charley coaxingly.</p>

<p>But Berry, always so gentle, suddenly turned stubborn
and flatly declined:</p>

<p>“I will have nothing to do now, or ever, with Miss
Montague!” she said, shaking her dark, curly head.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE UNWELCOME LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Charley took up the pen to write to his future stepmother,
and looked at his father.</p>

<p>“Shall you dictate, sir, or will you tell me your desires
and leave the rest to me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what to say, and you may put it
in your own words,” Senator Bonair replied.</p>

<p>So it happened in due time that there came across
the sea to anxious Rosalind this answer to her charming
love letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Rosalind</span>: You’ll be surprised to get this
letter from me in answer to your loving one to father,
but as you have consoled yourself for my fault, I
hope you bear no ill will, and that you are willing to
let bygones be bygones. To tell you the honest truth,
Rosalind, I’m so happy with my darling little wife, I
feel at peace and amity with the whole world, and as
dad wants me to write you this letter, I embrace the
chance to tell you so. I don’t mind your marrying
dad, if you love him. If not, please don’t, for his happiness
is very dear to me.</p>

<p>“You wondered why dad failed to write to you,
and he wants me to explain. Well, this is why: Along
late in August he came down here to the little village<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
by the sea, alone, with his valet, and first thing he
knew he came down with a horrid case of smallpox,
and everybody deserted him but Tousey, who didn’t
know a single thing about nursing or cooking, either,
so dad was likely to die. By the best luck in the world
my wife happened to be in the neighborhood (I was in
London myself), and she went to his aid, like a brick
(excuse slang). You see, she had had smallpox and
knew how to nurse it. She also knew how to get a
decent meal, so between her two accomplishments she
dragged dad out of the jaws of death. Then she
wrote me to send a London doctor, which I did, and
although the sick man went down to the gates of death
they dragged him back, and now he is convalescent,
but not allowed to read or write yet, so he is using
my pen and eyes to allay your anxiety.</p>

<p>“Of course, it follows, dad has forgiven Berry and
me, and just dotes now on my charming wife.</p>

<p>“But dad wishes me to say that our reconciliation
makes no difference in his duty and his feelings to you,
and that he has not reconsidered his disinheritance of
his disobedient son. Your marriage dower will be
quite as large as he had promised before, and the future
must take care of itself. I have won my suit for my
mother’s money, and if I never get a penny of dad’s
my little love and I can be perfectly happy without it.</p>

<p>“Dad will be home weeks before the wedding, so
don’t worry, he says, as he loves you as well as ever.
My sisters will be home before the wedding, too, he
says, but I don’t expect an invitation, and would not<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
come if you sent one! I suppose you and Berry won’t
care to meet for a good while yet, and I won’t force
a crisis. We will likely make our home over here,
anyway, as Berry isn’t used to society, and I’m not
rich enough to keep in the swim, either. So when
dad goes, I’m going to buy a fine automobile, and
we two, my love and I, are going touring in it. We
shall be as happy as two birds in a nest.</p>

<p>“The next letter will be from dad himself, telling
you when to expect him home. Good luck to you,
Rosalind, and good-by.</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“<span class="smcap">Charley Bonair.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the startling letter that threw Rosalind
into a fit of angry hysterics.</p>

<p>“The game is lost to me, I feel it, I know it! Oh,
why did I let him go away from me over there, where
those two scheming wretches were sure to nab him?
Why didn’t I insist on an immediate marriage, so as
to go with him? I was a fool letting him out of my
sight as I did!”</p>

<p>“Rosalind, your fears are groundless. Nothing but
some glaring fault in yourself would prevent the marriage,
and I tremble over this flirtation with Adrian
Vance if it even gets to his knowledge. You go too
far, indeed, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Quit preaching, for Heaven’s sake; you drive me
mad!” Rosalind cried angrily. “I shall flirt all I like,
and with whom I like, for when I am tied down in<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
wedlock with old Moneybags I shall have to be so
proper I shall die of dreariness!”</p>

<p>When she had got over her hysterical fit, she dressed
herself with care and went down to her guests, where
Adrian Vance always flew to attend to her lightest
wish. When they got away by themselves, presently,
in a shaded alcove behind the curtain, she said carelessly:</p>

<p>“I have just had a letter from the senator, and the
poor old man has had smallpox in a dreadful form.
I am wondering if he will be so pitted as to make him
more homely than he was before?”</p>

<p>“I hope he may be rendered so hideous that you will
break the engagement on sight,” he responded passionately.</p>

<p>“Ah, Adrian, I wish he had your good looks along
with his millions. Then I should be happy, indeed.”</p>

<p>He seized her white, jeweled hand in a crushing
pressure.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rosalind, why are you so cruel when I love
you so well and you pretend that you return it? Let
that old man go, and give yourself to me.”</p>

<p>“I promise you now,” she whispered softly, leaning
close to him, “that when old Moneybags dies and
leaves me his millions, I’ll take you, my dark-eyed<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
Adrian, for my second husband, and let you help to
spend the money.”</p>

<p>“You tempt me to murder him by the time the marriage
ceremony is over! Have a care, Rosalind, for
what you put in my head!” the man whispered back
hoarsely.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BITTER MEMORIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was two weeks later that the bride-elect got the
promised letter from Senator Bonair, saying that he
would follow the letter home, and hoped to greet her
by the first of December.</p>

<p>Further on in the letter, the senator mentioned he
hoped she was not sorry he had made up his quarrel
with Charley and his charming wife. He was getting
on in years, now, and it was such a comfort to
have a son for a staff to his declining years. Not that
he expected to see much of them, though, because the
happy pair intended to make their home abroad. Then,
too, Marie and Lucile had declined to meet or forgive
their brother and Berry, so it was best they should
dwell apart.</p>

<p>It rejoiced Rosalind’s heart to hear that her friends,
Marie and Lucile, had stood loyally by her and refused
to be reconciled to Charley and his humble bride.</p>

<p>“It is well that they oppose their father in this, else
the foolish old man would be wanting them to come
and live with us, and I am determined they shall never
cross the threshold of my home when I am married,”<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
she vowed to her mother, who approved the declaration,
saying that no one could ever expect Rosalind
to forgive the injury received at Charley Bonair’s
hands.</p>

<p>“Speaking of Charley’s wife reminds me, Rosalind,
that we must try to get that old woman, Mrs. Vining,
to come up and help at the hall for a week, finishing
up the sewing, as the seamstress says she must have
more help or she can never get through in time,” continued
her mother.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will stop at the cottage as I drive
down and see about it, mamma. I suppose she will
be glad to get the work, as I don’t think Berry’s grand
match has improved her mother’s fortunes. Indeed, I
wonder if she even knows that Charley married her
hateful actress daughter?” cried Rosalind.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think she has written home of her grand
match, for all the village seems to know of it. I have
heard our servants talking of it when they did not
know that I overheard their silly gossip. But, as you
say, it can do her no good. She has not apparently
benefited by it, as she still lives in the old weather-beaten
cottage.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will employ her,” declared Rosalind, “if
only to have the triumph of seeing Charley Bonair’s
poor old mother-in-law toiling for me. Ha, ha! what<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
a spectacle!” She ended with a harsh, grating laugh of
smothered rage.</p>

<p>When she drove out with Adrian Vance that afternoon,
she got him to wait at the cottage door, in the
automobile, while she went to see Mrs. Vining.</p>

<p>The woman’s youngest son, a boy of sixteen, met
her at the cottage door, and led her into the small,
neat sitting room, saying he would call his mother.</p>

<p>He disappeared, and Rosalind looked, superciliously,
about the small apartment with its dingy furnishings,
muttering:</p>

<p>“I would rather die than be poor and shabby. I declare
I don’t see how very poor folks endure such an
existence. Ah, what&mdash;&mdash;” the sentence ended abruptly,
and getting up with a swish of trailing silk and flutter
of rich laces, she swept across the room to a new easel
standing in a corner with a good-sized picture upon
it, representing a group of two&mdash;a picturesque group
of two lovers, a handsome man, a lovely white-gowned
girl, standing, hand in hand, amid tropical shrubbery.</p>

<p>Rosalind gazed with idle curiosity a moment, then
her eyes flashed, and a keen, bitter pain stabbed her
jealous heart like the point of a dagger.</p>

<p>The picture was a large, framed photograph of
Charley Bonair and Berry that they had sent to Mrs.
Vining months before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>The beauty and the happiness of the handsome pair
struck Rosalind’s heart with bitterness, but while she
gazed the mother’s voice said, just behind her:</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Montague, you’re admiring the picture
of my little girl and her husband. It’s the image of
Berry, bless her dear heart, don’t you think so, miss?
She sent it to me a while ago, and oh, how glad I am
the dear girl is happily married! But I beg pardon,
can I do anything for you, Miss Montague?”</p>

<p>“I am to be married soon, you know, Mrs. Vining,
to Senator Bonair, and some of my simpler things
are being done at home by seamstresses. Mamma
sent me to ask if you will come and help finish up,
next week? She will pay you more than you can earn
at the tailor shop.”</p>

<p>“But I am not at the tailor shop now, Miss Montague.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Have they discharged you, then?” insolently.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, miss; I left of my own accord. I’m getting
to be an old woman now, and must rest for the balance
of my life.”</p>

<p>Rosalind looked more closely, and noted a more
prosperous air about Berry’s mother than she had ever
seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>“I do not understand how you expect to live without
work,” she said sharply.</p>

<p>“It does seem strange to you, doesn’t it now, Miss
Montague, seeing how I have been working and toiling
here all my life? My son-in-law, out of his good
heart, has sent me a present of a thousand dollars to
take my ease on, and says there’s more to come when I
have spent it all.”</p>

<p>“So then you will not come to sew?” Rosalind exclaimed
sneeringly.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Montague. I’d rather not, thank you all
the same for giving me the chance if I needed it, but
Berry wrote I mustn’t work any more.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, then,” Rosalind cried, with an angry flirt
of her skirts that tumbled the picture off the easel and
splintered the glass over it; while with a smothered,
malicious laugh at what she had done through pure
spitefulness, she swept from the house, leaving the old
woman busy gathering up the fragments.</p>

<p>“I’m cross; I don’t care to drive to-day. We will
go back home,” she said to Adrian Vance sharply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montague spied her coming, and came to meet
her, saying:</p>

<p>“You got back sooner than I looked for, Rosalind,
but none too soon, for a cablegram has just come to<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
you, saying Senator Bonair cannot sail as soon as he
expected, but hopes not to be delayed much longer.”</p>

<p>“He cannot come? Why? Is this another scheme
to postpone the wedding?” Rosalind cried, in a loud,
angry voice.</p>

<p>“Hush, Rosalind, don’t fly off into a rage so fast, and
I’ll tell you the rest. The senator explains his disappointment
by saying that Charley and his wife had a
wreck while coming on their automobile from Trouville
to Paris, and that both are so terribly injured they may
not survive the day.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">DELAYS ARE DANGEROUS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was true, that dreadful cablegram that shocked
even Rosalind’s cruel heart! For a moment she gasped
with surprise and grew pale even to her rosy lips.</p>

<p>But the next moment she threw off the spell and
laughed gratingly, so that even the worldly-wise mother
said rebukingly:</p>

<p>“How can you laugh, my dear girl? It is really
very shocking to think of that young pair being so
terribly injured in an automobile accident that they
must almost certainly die.”</p>

<p>But Rosalind only laughed again.</p>

<p>“Mamma, what is the use of your acting goody-goody
when you know what all this means to me?” she
sneered. “In the first place, I hate Charley Bonair
who jilted me, and his wife who supplanted me, with
a bitter hatred that can only rejoice in their deaths,
so why should I pull a long face, when nothing could
please me better? And, secondly, if they had lived,
old Moneybags might have revoked his disinheritance
of his son, and cut me out of some of his millions at
his death. So what seems like a calamity to them is a<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
benefit to me, and I rejoice accordingly. Mother,”
she added, as with a sudden thought, “I shall cross the
ocean to my betrothed’s side! I shall have to do the
sympathy act, of course&mdash;snivel and whine, and pretend
to be sorry they are dead, while my heart is full
of rejoicing! But no matter, so that I gain my end!”</p>

<p>“But, Rosalind, my dear, what can be gained by
such proceedings?”</p>

<p>“How stupid you are, to be sure, mamma! You
must be getting into your dotage not to see that if he
goes into mourning for his son, and objects to a public
marriage with all its attendant sensation, I can easily
lure him into a quiet, private marriage on the spot, and
come home Mrs. Senator Bonair, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is a very clever idea, Rosalind&mdash;a
good idea all around, for then we shall be spared the
trouble and expense of a grand wedding, for which it
would have been hard to raise the money, and your
father’s affairs in such a fix! But for that matter it
won’t be easy to get it for your trip, either. Besides,
you know, I cannot leave your father’s sick bed to
chaperon you, and you could not properly go alone.”</p>

<p>“All that can be easily arranged. Our late visitor,
Mrs. Brander, sails in two days for Europe to join her
married son in Paris, and she will be only too glad<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
to have my company on the trip. For the rest, I can
sell some of my jewels for the passage money. I shall
have plenty more as soon as I am married.”</p>

<p>“It is all very easy as you have planned it, and I
don’t doubt you will succeed with such an indomitable
will as you are now displaying,” commended Mrs.
Montague.</p>

<p>“We must begin to get you ready to start in the
morning to join Mrs. Brander,” she went on. “I suppose
you had better break the news to our remaining
guests, at once, that Senator Bonair has cabled for you
to come to Paris. I hope they will all take their departures
quickly, as under the circumstances they ought
to do.”</p>

<p>The guests were all of the same mind with her, and
after hearing the sad news and offering formal condolences
suited to the occasion, did some hasty packing
and were all out of the house by nightfall, the last
one to leave being Adrian Vance, who said, as he
pressed her hand at parting:</p>

<p>“I shall lodge in the town to-night and bear you
company to New York on the morning train. Indeed
I am not sure but I shall follow you to Paris on the
same steamer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, you must not! I shall not permit it,”<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
she replied, with a glance that belied her word, and
silently invited him to disobey her mandate.</p>

<p>As a result he kept his word, and as soon as the
steamer left her moorings he joined Rosalind and
her chaperon as their traveling companion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TRUE TO HIS WORD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was true that Lucile and Marie, who, with their
husbands, were now in Paris, had hardened their
hearts absolutely against their brother and his lowly
born bride.</p>

<p>They had joined their father at his hotel, but after
they had heard the whole story of Berenice’s care and
devotion that had saved his life, they were rebellious;
they could not forgive.</p>

<p>The sisters remembered how beautiful and charming
Berenice had been that one night upon the stage at
Bonair, but the thought of that beauty only hardened
their hearts, since it was this that had made their
brother a traitor to Rosalind.</p>

<p>“Papa, we cannot look at it as you do; the cases
are different,” they said to their father. “And if you
want our advice it would be to give them a large sum
of money rather than try to secure social recognition
for them that would result in many unpleasant complications.”</p>

<p>“I did not think you could be so cruel to your only
brother who loved you so well,” their father said rebukingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>“He put that low-born actress before us and Rosalind
in his heart,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Rosalind, always Rosalind! I am sick of the very
name! Do you owe no duty to others?” he cried
angrily, and they started with surprise.</p>

<p>“Rosalind is to be your wife and our stepmother&mdash;we
should consider her first,” they replied stubbornly.</p>

<p>“By Heaven, I wish I had never promised to marry
the girl! I wish I could get honorably free of her
claim, for my son is dearer to me than Rosalind can
ever be, and I detest the thought that she is to stand
forever between Charley’s heart and mine!” the senator
stormed, in sudden desperation, outraged by their
heartlessness.</p>

<p>Marie and Lucile listened in the greatest wonder,
and they cried out simultaneously:</p>

<p>“We thought you loved Rosalind better than any
of us!”</p>

<p>In his anger he replied truthfully:</p>

<p>“I have never pretended to love her, and I regret
now I ever made the rash promise to marry her, for
very likely she only desires it to get revenge on Charley
and Berenice for their fault against her, which was
not so dreadful, after all, for my son swears he confessed
all to Rosalind first and asked release from his
engagement to her, although afterward she denied it<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
to us, and we rashly took her word against Charley’s.
When I look back I remember that Rosalind really
courted me first instead of my courting her, and
through an old man’s flattered vanity and the wish to
atone for Charley’s fault, I promised to make her my
bride. But now I swear I am sorry for it, and wish
I could retreat in honor, for I shrink from putting another
in the place of your dead mother, my beloved
wife; and, besides, I do not believe in the union of
May and December.”</p>

<p>“But, papa, you cannot retreat from your bond. It
would be unfair to Rosalind; it would be worse than
Charley, for the wedding day is barely a month off,”
they reminded him.</p>

<p>“No, I cannot retreat in honor. I must marry Rosalind
and make the most of my life,” he replied bitterly,
adding:</p>

<p>“Fortunately my private business and affairs of
state engross most of my time, and as for her, I suppose
she will be happy enough spending my money
and flirting with younger men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” cried Lucile reproachfully.</p>

<p>“For shame, papa!” cried Marie indignantly.</p>

<p>But in their hearts they both knew he spoke truly.</p>

<p>Rosalind was extravagant to a fault, and a bold
coquette&mdash;they could not deny either charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>But Rosalind had been their schoolmate and chum;
she was in their set, she was handsome in her way,
and they would not be ashamed of her, as they must
be of poor little Berenice, the lowly born bride of
their only brother.</p>

<p>So they held out for Rosalind, declaring it was only
loyal to do so, and beseeching their father not to jilt
her as Charley had done.</p>

<p>He, on his part, promised faithfulness, and the
interview ended, much to the relief of all parties, having
been productive of no good on either side.</p>

<p>The young wives, having told everything to their
proud and exceptionable husbands, were consoled and
sympathized with, and told that they had acted right.</p>

<p>So Senator Bonair, who had almost promised Charley
that they should have a family reunion and reconciliation
at Paris, was obliged to write to his son that
his sisters were obdurate and unforgiving and that
when he came to bid him farewell, he could not meet
the kindred he loved so well; because, in their loyalty
to Rosalind, they would not forgive his folly nor recognize
his bride.</p>

<p>It was cruelly hard on Charley, who had hoped so
much from his father’s intercession, and when he
showed the letter to Berenice, he said bitterly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>“They were sweet, loving girls before they came
under Rosalind’s baleful influence, and I wish they
could know her as well as I do, and realize her catlike,
revengeful nature, then they would not harden their
hearts against us any longer. It is by her cruel machinations
I am sure that Marie and Lucile have become
so heartless.”</p>

<p>“But, Charley, even if we could turn their hearts
against her, by telling any harm we knew, it would
not be right, because we have already injured her in
her tenderest affections,” his lovely bride said gently.</p>

<p>“Affections!” laughed Charley scornfully. “All her
love is for money and position, and in wedding my
father she will gain more than she lost in me.”</p>

<p>He was wrong, but he had never realized in his
indifference to Rosalind that the girl had doted on him
with her whole heart, or that slighted love had driven
her to madness. It is true she would not have looked
at him twice had he been penniless, but having looked,
she had truly loved.</p>

<p>Charley read on from his letter that his father was
sailing soon for America, and he hoped they would
not forget the promised visit to bid him farewell.</p>

<p>“We will go to-morrow,” the young man said
eagerly. “I will tell my chauffeur to have everything<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
ready for a fine automobile trip, so that we may go
as fast as the wind, for there is nothing I enjoy so
much.”</p>

<p>When the order had been given he returned to clasp
her to his heart, and say, with passionate devotion:</p>

<p>“Do not think I am fretting because my sisters will
have nothing to say to us. Although I love them well,
I love you, my dearest, more than all the world besides.
I can be happy without them, and perhaps it is
best we should remain sundered from the family since
Rosalind is to make one of it, and she would always
be plotting against us. Henceforth we will live only
for each other.”</p>

<p>Next day came the terrible accident, when the automobile,
flying from Trouville to Paris, at a high rate
of speed, came into collision with a huge rock that
sent it flying upward as it exploded, its passengers
being scattered upon the flinty ground, the chauffeur
meeting instant death, and Charley and Berry such terrible
injuries that it was pronounced impossible for
either to survive the shock.</p>

<p>The next day the news was in all the newspapers
of England, France, and America, and in the roadside
cottage to which the victims had been tenderly
carried after the terrible accident, a broken-hearted<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
father and two remorseful sisters bent over the unconscious
forms in agonies of grief, the father crying:
“Thank Heaven I forgave them!” The sisters, weeping
bitterly: “Heaven forgive our cruelty that we did
not!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A LATE REMORSE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the dreadful news was carried quickly to
Paris, Lucile and Marie forgot all their pride and resentment
and remembered only the love and pride they
had once had in Charley, their beloved brother.</p>

<p>They set out quickly for the scene of the accident,
accompanied by their father and husbands, and they
took with them two of the most skillful physicians in
the city, hoping they might render some service to the
sufferers. When they reached the cottage they found
the sufferers hovering between life and death.</p>

<p>The poor chauffeur had met death instantly, and as
no one knew if he had any friends at all, preparations
were already made to give him a respectable
burial in hallowed ground.</p>

<p>When examinations had been duly made it was
found that Charley was more seriously injured than
his wife. He had an arm and some ribs broken, in addition
to many bruises, while Berenice had no bones
broken at all, and if she had no internal injuries she
ought to recover, the physicians said.</p>

<p>She presently proved the correctness of their diagnosis<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
by rallying under treatment and opening her eyes
in a vacant stare that as yet had no light of reason in
it; but as for Charley, he was too badly off to show
any signs of life for twenty-four hours, save the faint
throbbing of his heart. They feared concussion of
the brain.</p>

<p>Marie and Lucile, overwhelmed with remorse, outdid
themselves in devotion.</p>

<p>As for Senator Bonair, if ever a thought of his betrothed
crossed his mind it was with poignant regret
that he had given her a promise he could not, in
honor, break.</p>

<p>When the patients began to show signs of improvement
it only aggravated his chagrin against Rosalind;
but for the wedding he could have taken these two
dear ones with him to Washington, where Berenice
would have made a lovely mistress for the grand new
home he had built.</p>

<p>It was strange how quickly the young wife rallied
and improved. She had suffered from severe mental
shock more than physical injury, and in a week she
was able to sit and watch by Charley’s bed and smooth
his hot brow with her soft, trembling little hands, vying
with the sisters and the nurse who performed the
more onerous duties.</p>

<p>A frail white lily, so pure, so fragile, she looked to<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
the sisters who had hated her so, but who now pitied
and loved her for her own sweet sake as well as her
unfailing devotion to their brother.</p>

<p>So the days came and went until over two weeks
had passed; then the grieving family had a great
surprise.</p>

<p>There stopped one day before the cottage a carriage,
and out of it stepped Rosalind, in her handsomest
traveling gown, with an anxious look on her beautiful
face.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear senator!” she cried, holding up her
face for a kiss, as he stepped out to meet her. “How
glad I am to see you again! As soon as I got your
cablegram I started to come to you, feeling that in
your trouble my place was by your side to comfort
you, for I feared that Marie and Lucile could not
come as soon as I.”</p>

<p>She had scarcely uttered the words when the sisters
came out to greet her with kisses and loving welcomes.</p>

<p>“But I thought you were absent on your wedding
tours?” cried Rosalind, secretly chagrined at their return.</p>

<p>They led her into the small sitting room, and she
added, with eager curiosity:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>“I was told in Paris that your brother is living yet,
but cannot recover. Is it true?”</p>

<p>“He is living yet&mdash;and we hope he may recover,”
Marie said tearfully, without noticing Rosalind’s frown
at the news.</p>

<p>Stifling an angry sob, Rosalind continued spitefully:</p>

<p>“And that horrid girl&mdash;the daughter of our village
tailoress&mdash;she also lives, I suppose? You cannot kill
such people! They are very tough.”</p>

<p>She was startled when Lucile said, with a certain
proud dignity:</p>

<p>“Please do not talk like that any more, Rosalind,
for she is my sister now.”</p>

<p>“And my daughter,” Senator Bonair said tenderly.</p>

<p>“And a sweet, lovely creature!” Marie added
frankly.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word!” cried Rosalind, in frank
anger and amazement. She realized that Berenice was
forgiven; worse still&mdash;beloved.</p>

<p>An insane anger took possession of her, and she
longed to strike every one in the face. It seemed to
her, in her fury, that she could kill them.</p>

<p>Her anger gave way to hysterical sobbing, and then
the sisters fell to soothing her tenderly and explaining
how it all came about.</p>

<p>The senator had retreated, frowningly, at the first<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
signs of hysterics, so the three were all alone, and the
sisters felt it was the time to give good advice.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rosalind, you will have to give in and be very
friendly, or papa will be displeased with you,” they
said. “And, after all, it will be better to have peace
in the family, don’t you think so? For even if poor
Charley lives, he and his wife will never intrude on
you, unless you invite them, you know. But now, in
the face of death, papa will not love you as well if
you do not forgive.”</p>

<p>It was a bitter pill for Rosalind, but she knew they
were still her friends, and she did not care to antagonize
them until she gained her point.</p>

<p>She sobbed dismally a moment or two, then lifted a
piteous face, and murmured:</p>

<p>“Then I must try to forgive my enemies, for your
father is the only friend I have in the world now, and
if he turns against me I am all undone.”</p>

<p>“Why, how strangely you are talking, Rosalind&mdash;you
who have a father and mother, and hosts of
friends!” they cried, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Alas! you cannot guess at all my troubles. Listen
and you will own that my words are true. My father,
in his extreme old age, has met with financial disaster
that has wrecked his mind. He is confined to his room,
my mother his constant, watchful attendant. But<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
worst of all, I have incurred my mother’s anger by undertaking
alone this journey to be by your father’s side
in his troubles. She forbade me to come. She said
it was indiscreet, unwomanly, and that I could never
hold up my head again if I outraged society by such a
step. She refused me the money for my journey, so I
sold my jewels to pay my passage over here.”</p>

<p>“Dear heart!” murmured Marie, pressing Rosalind’s
white hand, while Lucile added:</p>

<p>“How noble!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” cried Rosalind eagerly. “And
do you think your father will be as noble in return?
For mamma said if I dared risk my reputation coming
to him alone this way there was but one thing a man
of honor could do in return for such blind devotion,
and that was to marry me out of hand, to silence gossiping
tongues. Not that I mind, dear girls, but for
mamma’s sake&mdash;she is old and prudish, you know&mdash;do
you think he would be willing to quiet her foolish
scruples and ease my heart by a quiet marriage
to-morrow? Do you think he would be willing to do
me this kindness? Will you, my dear friends, ask
him for me?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A BITTER SECRET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Rosalind Montague here! Ah, Heaven, what ill
work is on foot now?”</p>

<p>The words broke almost unconsciously from Berenice’s
lips when they told her that her arch enemy was
in the house.</p>

<p>She flung out protecting arms, and clasped Charley,
as he lay in a half stupor on his couch, murmuring,
half distractedly:</p>

<p>“Ah, my love, my love, I must guard you now from
her hate as well as from your terrible illness. I will
never leave your side, never, my darling, never leave
you alone, lest her baleful presence overwhelm your
life!”</p>

<p>The startled sisters thought she must have suddenly
gone mad with unwarrantable hatred of Rosalind,
and they tried to soothe her frenzy.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, what wild words are you saying?
Do you not realize that it is wiser to be friends with
Rosalind, who will have, as our father’s wife, more influence
over him than any one else? She is willing
to be friends with you, and that is noble in Rosalind,
for she was the wronged one in the beginning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>But the beautiful young wife, who looked so gentle
and spoke so softly, could be spirited enough when she
chose, and she tossed her head proudly and cried, with
flashing eyes and crimson cheeks:</p>

<p>“I will never be friends with cruel Rosalind, never!
Oh, take her away from here, I beseech you, and
leave me alone with my Charley, in peace and safety.
You may all go with her if you wish, only send her
away, for I cannot know a moment’s peace under the
same roof with Rosalind!”</p>

<p>Lucile whispered to her sister: “It is pure jealousy,
nothing else&mdash;and how silly in Berenice to fear that
Rosalind wants to steal Charley’s heart away!”</p>

<p>“Tell her the truth, and she will get over it,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>And so they broke it to Berenice that they had been
talking over matters with their father, explaining Rosalind’s
wishes, and he had agreed to marry her quietly
to-morrow, to silence the tongue of gossip that might
babble because she had come alone to him across
the sea.</p>

<p>Berenice was almost petrified with astonishment at
the unexpected news.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is horrible to think of!” she cried vehemently.
“Must this terrible sacrifice go on? Will no
one save the victim?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>The sisters began to feel very angry with Berenice,
she was so stubborn, so unjust to Rosalind.</p>

<p>It was no use arguing with her, she would not listen
to reason. They decided to appeal the case to their
father.</p>

<p>They told him all Berenice’s resentment, all her
hatred of Rosalind, whom she had already wronged so
deeply, and they told him it was his duty to lecture the
unreasonable young wife and compass her reconciliation
with Rosalind.</p>

<p>“For if Rosalind is willing to forgive her, Berenice
ought to be thankful to be forgiven,” they said, very
pertinently, and indeed it seemed that way.</p>

<p>So Senator Bonair himself went to argue the case
with his daughter-in-law, which he did with all the
eloquence at his command, since it was the dearest
wish of his warm heart to have all his family on
friendly terms.</p>

<p>Berenice listened with downcast eyes and heaving
breast to every word, for she knew she was being
blamed for causeless resentment.</p>

<p>They thought Charley was asleep in so deep a stupor
he comprehended nothing, but suddenly he opened his
eyes full upon them with the clear light of reason shining
through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Charley, do you know us? Have we disturbed
you?” sobbed Berenice. And he answered weakly:</p>

<p>“I have been hearing and understanding all you and
father said, and I think you are in the wrong, my
darling.”</p>

<p>“In the wrong?” she panted.</p>

<p>“Yes, all in the wrong. If Rosalind wants to be
friends with us, let us yield for father’s sake, because
it will make him happier.”</p>

<p>Berenice slipped her cold hand in his and looked up
wistfully at her father-in-law, saying:</p>

<p>“Do you then love Rosalind so very much?”</p>

<p>For a moment the senator hesitated, then he answered
frankly:</p>

<p>“I have never pretended to love Rosalind, but I
esteem and admire her very much, so that I am willing
to marry her, to atone for Charley’s desertion.”</p>

<p>“Then we should all make sacrifices to that end,”
she murmured rather bitterly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we should,” the senator replied, out
of his high code of honor, though his heart was heavy
in his breast with thoughts of the wedding to-morrow.</p>

<p>Charley pressed the cold little hand that nestled in his
and faltered weakly:</p>

<p>“I agree with father, Berenice. We should be friends
with his future wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Charley, you would not ask me if you knew
all!” she sobbed, then suddenly:</p>

<p>“Forgive me, for we have wronged Rosalind so
much that we cannot sit in judgment on her sins. Yes,
yes, I will bury my resentment, I will be friends for
your sakes, not for hers.”</p>

<p>They were glad of even that concession, and Senator
Bonair hastened to say that he would like to bring
Rosalind in and have the greeting over, that is, if it
would not agitate Charley too much.</p>

<p>Charley faintly protested that he should not mind
at all.</p>

<p>So presently the smiling beauty was ushered in to
where Berenice sat stroking Charley’s thin hand so
tenderly in hers, and though the sight almost drove
her wild with anger, she kept her cool, set smile, and
spoke calmly, with friendly words of greeting, though
the hand she touched to theirs was so cold it made
them shudder.</p>

<p>“I am intruding only for a moment,” she smiled, and
quickly withdrew on the senator’s arm, while Charley
dropped asleep again, and Berenice sobbed to herself
in silent grief:</p>

<p>“Oh, my secret, my bitter secret I have kept so long,
would that I could forget it now!”</p>

<p>The day waned to a close, the purple gloaming fell,<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
and the nurse who had had a day off for rest, now
came in, saying:</p>

<p>“You have been in so closely all day you must go
out into the fresh air and rest a while. I will watch
your husband carefully.”</p>

<p>She wondered why Berenice caught her hand so
tightly, whispering passionately:</p>

<p>“I will not go until you promise to remain closely by
the bed and not to trust him to any other, not even
his father and sisters, till I return.”</p>

<p>“I promise faithfully, madam,” returned the nurse.</p>

<p>“That is well,” said Berenice briefly, and she slipped
out into the fragrant, balmy gloaming, with a sense of
relief in the perfect solitude.</p>

<p>She walked down the quiet country road a little
way, drawing back into the shadows as a man passed
her on his way toward the cottage, reining his horse
up there a little later, as she saw to her intense surprise.
For a moment, in one hurried glance, she
thought she recognized this man. Was he, could he
possibly be Adrian Vance, her own mother’s prodigal
son, by a former marriage? Ah, no! it was impossible
that Adrian should appear on the scene, now,
after all these years of absence, during which he had
never seen or written to his mother.</p>

<p>“I must not go any farther,” she said, pausing suddenly<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
and sitting down beneath a low-spreading tree,
the center of a thick undergrowth of shrubbery. “I
will sit here and think over my troubles a while, for
my heart misgives me I am not doing right to hold my
peace and let Charley’s noble father marry wicked
Rosalind. She does not love him, I am sure, and&mdash;ah,
there are voices. Some one is passing; I hope I shall
not be seen.”</p>

<p>She drew back and almost held her breath, seeing
through the dark branches that a man and woman
were walking together toward her retreat. She started
in wonder when she saw that it was Rosalind and the
man she had seen on horseback.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A STOLEN INTERVIEW.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I must not go any farther, and I cannot stay out
long, for I must not be missed. Let us stop here under
the trees and talk a little while, but it was wrong and
foolish for you to come, Adrian,” said Rosalind.</p>

<p>“But I could not stay away. I love you too well!”
cried the passionate lover, and before she could reply,
he continued:</p>

<p>“I was wild to see you and to hear how old Moneybags,
as you call him, looks since he had the smallpox.
I am hoping he is so badly pitted and ugly that you are
disgusted and ready to throw him over.”</p>

<p>Berenice held her breath; she knew it was wrong to
listen, but curiosity got the better of courtesy.</p>

<p>“He is homely enough, I assure you, to disgust any
squeamish person,” answered Rosalind, with a laugh,
“but I would marry him if he were the Old Boy himself,
with all that money.”</p>

<p>“How I hate him and envy him!” complained the
man bitterly. “If I had only half that money, would
you marry me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for only half of it, and be thankful!” cried<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
Rosalind. “For, after all, I shall not get more than
half, anyway. There are his two daughters to inherit,
and, besides, he has made up with Charley; and
unless I play my cards very cleverly he will revoke that
disinheritance and leave him a million or so, very
likely.”</p>

<p>“But I thought his son was going to die?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind. He is recovering very fast,
and so is his wife, the low actress, and they think I have
forgiven them and will have them whining around me
after I marry the father. But nothing of the kind,
I can assure you, for I have sworn they shall never
cross the senator’s threshold when once it is mine.”</p>

<p>“It is hard lines on you, Rosalind, after thinking
them both dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, is it not? I am almost tempted to give him an
overdose of something when no one is looking. It
would soon finish him in his weak state, eh?”</p>

<p>It almost seemed to Berenice that the man’s shuddering
shook the branches where he leaned, or was it
only a light wind?</p>

<p>He said quickly:</p>

<p>“Ugh! Rosalind, you make me shudder, you say
jesting things so seriously. No, don’t poison the poor
fellow. Murder will out, you know. Oh, I say, darling,
cut it all and come away with me and be married<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
in Paris. We love each other, and we can be
happy somehow. As for money, there’s the gambling
table. I never told you I broke the bank at Monte
Carlo once. I did, and I can do it again.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been over all that before, Adrian, to no
good. Why repeat it? I love you as well as I once
loved Charley, but I will never marry any but a rich
man, I swear. But I have promised you, and I mean
it, that you shall be my true lover, while old Moneybags
lives, and when he dies, my second husband,”
Rosalind answered frankly, and the man sighed:</p>

<p>“Do you think he will live long, Rosalind?”</p>

<p>“No, not very long, my own Adrian, for there are
many easy ways to hurry an old man into his grave.
But it is too soon to talk of that, now. Wait till I’m
safely his wife and get his will made in my favor, then
you and I can plot the finish, see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see, and I am with you to the end&mdash;and
afterward. Ah, Rosalind, what a woman you are!
If you did not love me I should be afraid of you!”
Adrian Vance muttered huskily.</p>

<p>Rosalind gave one of her harsh, grating laughs, and
said:</p>

<p>“Love can turn to hate.”</p>

<p>“You mean that I should beware of you. But I<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
cannot, my queen, for I worship you. And&mdash;and&mdash;I
shall be so jealous of that old man when he owns
you that I shall be tempted to thrust a knife into his
heart!”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t, Adrian! Poison in his winecup would
be safer, you know. But I must leave you, for I have
much to do. I am to be married to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Heavens&mdash;to-morrow!” gasped her lover wildly,
jealously.</p>

<p>She answered lightly:</p>

<p>“To-morrow, for the senator proposed it and insists
upon it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! how shall I bear my jealous agony? One kiss,
Rosalind!”</p>

<p>Berenice turned hot and cold, hearing repeated kisses
and ardent caresses that made the leaves rustle as they
leaned against them, then they sprang apart.</p>

<p>“We must go back, Adrian; I really cannot stay another
minute. Do not grieve so. You will not be
banished, you know. I shall soon introduce you as a
friend of the family. Ha! ha!”</p>

<p>They passed out of sight, still talking, leaving Berenice
crouched beneath the tree, with hot cheeks and
a wildly beating heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly she got upon her knees on the dewy grass<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
and lifted her wide, horrified dark eyes to the heavens,
where myriad stars began to sparkle through the blue.</p>

<p>With clasped hands she prayed piteously:</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do? Can I let this fiend impose
on this good, honorable old man and shame the name he
will give her by a liaison with this unworthy lover, who
will help her to murder him at last for his money?
Oh, it is too horrible that I should keep her terrible
secrets and let the sacrifice go on! I must save him,
I must expose her in all her hideous depravity to those
who love and trust her now. Oh, show me the way,
show me the way to-morrow, to unmask this fiend!”</p>

<p>Berenice was walking past the open door of the sitting
room, when Marie called to her kindly:</p>

<p>“Come in, you dear, pale little ghost, and help us
to plan for the wedding this evening.”</p>

<p>Berenice’s heart gave a wild, startled leap as she
obeyed.</p>

<p>They were all there together, the sisters with their
husbands, the senator and Rosalind, all planning for the
wedding that Berenice knew must never be.</p>

<p>The senator placed a chair for her and started when
he saw her pallid face with the dark circles around the
heavy eyes. Even her little hands were trembling with
terrible agitation.</p>

<p>“Really, Berenice, you look ill this morning. Did
you have a bad night, dear?” Lucile asked, with affectionate
interest.</p>

<p>“Yes, I had a very bad night. I could not sleep.
Something troubled my mind,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“You must learn not to take your troubles to bed
with you, child,” declared Marie; “it’s the worst plan
in the world. But stay with us and we will divert you,
talking about the wedding. Do you think this room<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
will do, if we order some flowers? It is very small,
to be sure, but there will be no invited guests. Poor
Rosalind has not even a wedding gown of white, except
an old torn lace robe that she brought in her dressing
bag with her, to see if the clever lacemakers of France
could mend it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a priceless, real lace gown,” explained
Rosalind, “that I wore at a ball at Bonair one night,
and some clumsy partner of mine must have put his
foot through the edge of the flounce and torn it, for
there’s a piece as large as your hand torn out and missing,
though the servants searched the ballroom carefully
for it next morning. You remember the very
night, Berry,” graciously, “for you played on the Bonair
stage that night in ‘A Wayside Flower.’”</p>

<p>Berenice parted her dry lips with a sort of gasp, and
murmured, in husky tones:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I should remember it, I think, for it was
on that same night the disguised fortune teller, my
secret enemy, tried to murder me by pushing me into
the bear pit, hoping Zilla would kill me in her rage
over being disturbed with her young.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that terrible night; don’t recall it!” shuddered
Rosalind, adding, to change the subject: “My misfortune
with my costly lace gown was as nothing compared
to your dreadful accident.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[255]</span></p>

<p>Berenice smiled strangely, for all at once there had
come to her the answer to her prayer of last night to
be shown some way to bring her enemy to confusion.</p>

<p>She forced herself to look at Rosalind, courteously,
but feeling all the while like a traitor, as she said:</p>

<p>“But cannot the gown be patched up for the ceremony,
some way, with a scrap of lace? I think I
might help you, as I have some fine lace, and am rather
skillful with the needle. Will you show it to me?”</p>

<p>“Willingly!” cried Rosalind, falling into the trap,
and hastening to secure the gown that was folded
away in a dressing bag she had brought.</p>

<p>She came back and unfolded the tissue wrappers and
spread the lovely web of lace open before their eyes.</p>

<p>There, in the front flounce, was the great tear, as
big as your hand, marring all its beauty. Every one
began to exclaim over it in sympathy with Rosalind.</p>

<p>“Now, a needle and some very fine thread, please,”
said trembling Berenice, and when they were supplied
she opened a large gold locket on her bosom and drew
from it a little wad of lace that when fitted into the
torn flounce matched the pattern perfectly.</p>

<p>Several voices cried, in unison:</p>

<p>“The missing piece of lace&mdash;how wonderful!”</p>

<p>“You found it!” cried Rosalind, in amazement.
“But where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>But even as she spoke she turned slightly pale, and
added:</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter where it was found so that
I have it back. What a fuss we are all making over a
bit of lace!”</p>

<p>“You made fuss enough yourself when it was lost at
Bonair!” cried Marie, sharply, while they all fell to
watching Berenice, who was putting in the torn lace
with neat little stitches, though her hands shook sadly,
so that she said:</p>

<p>“I am making a poor job of it, Miss Montague, but
you can get a real lace maker to do it over again for
you. You see, it makes me so nervous just thinking of
the night when I found this scrap of lace, and of all
I suffered afterward.”</p>

<p>“Try not to think of it at all,” soothingly said Rosalind,
but Berenice raised her dark eyes, swimming in
tears, and murmured:</p>

<p>“I must think of it, for it is my duty to tell everything
I know about that night.”</p>

<p>“Go on, I am sure it will be very interesting,” exclaimed
Clarence Carlisle, Marie’s husband.</p>

<p>“I needn’t tell about that night when I was pushed
into the bear pit,” continued Berenice, “for all that
are here have heard the story over and over, but some<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
things that I never told before I mean to betray now,
and one is that the pretended Indian seeress was no
Indian at all, but a disguised and jealous enemy of
mine, who desired to compass my death. I am sure
of it, for in our struggle on the edge of the pit the
woman uttered some angry words, in her own voice,
which I instantly recognized. Then I clutched at her,
and as I fell I knew I had something clutched in my
frantic grasp that I had torn from her gown. It was
this piece of lace that Mrs. Cline, simple soul, not
dreaming of the mute witness it bore against my would-be
murderer, disentangled from my unconscious fingers
and kept for me. But it did not need this mute witness
for me, for as I fell I saw my enemy’s face
and heard her taunting voice, and I knew you, Miss
Montague, for what you were, a guilty sinner, wreaking
a terrible revenge on a hapless rival. Then when
Charley sprang down to my rescue, you flew back and
tried to destroy him also by a cowardly bullet, for the
Clines saw the white figure running away from the
scene of the double crime.”</p>

<p>She heard low, startled cries all around her, and
lifting her accusing eyes she looked at Rosalind.</p>

<p>Out of her dead-white face her blue eyes glared like
two points of steel, with murder in their gleam, and
from between her stiff, white lips came bleakly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[258]</span></p>

<p>“You lie! Had this charge been true, you would
have told the secret long ago.”</p>

<p>Berenice, paling, trembling, continued:</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, for an impulse of generous pity
made me keep your hideous secret locked fast in my
own breast, until now. I never meant to speak until&mdash;last
night&mdash;when&mdash;I&mdash;heard&mdash;you&mdash;with&mdash;your&mdash;lover&mdash;beneath&mdash;the
trees!”</p>

<p>“Liar! Viper! Oh, let me tear her false tongue
from her lips!” snarled Rosalind, but strong hands
pinioned her and held her back, that Berenice might
finish speaking.</p>

<p>She turned her dark, solemn, truthful eyes upon her
father-in-law.</p>

<p>“Last night the nurse sent me out for a breath of
fresh air, and while I rested under the trees a man
passed by on horseback and reined up before the cottage
gate. He came back presently with Rosalind, and
not dreaming of my presence they talked over their terrible
secrets together. Those two lovers, Senator Bonair,
ridiculed you, laughed at you as old Moneybags,
plotted to remain lovers after her marriage to you, and
to make way with you as quickly as possible that she
might take him for a second husband. Then they
sealed their terrible bargain with a hundred kisses and
caresses, and went away, unconscious of a listener,<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
who, to save you, sir, from their cruel machinations,
has broken the silence of more than a year to warn you
of lurking danger, if you marry Rosalind Montague.”</p>

<p>The voice ceased and Berenice waited with a beating
heart for them all to denounce her and take Rosalind’s
part.</p>

<p>Then Senator Bonair said dully, as if shocked into
apathy:</p>

<p>“Now, Rosalind, for your defense!”</p>

<p>She answered, with angry evasion:</p>

<p>“If you can take that low creature’s word against
mine, why need I attempt a defense?”</p>

<p>Marie’s husband spoke up quickly:</p>

<p>“I can corroborate Mrs. Bonair’s word in one thing.
Last night I saw the horseman she spoke of ride up to
the gate, saw Miss Montague meet him and walk away
with him. Afterward witnessed their return and parting,
with a kiss. You remember, Dallas, I told you and
asked your advice?”</p>

<p>“And I counseled secrecy over what seemed the close
of perhaps a harmless flirtation,” Dallas Dreem replied.</p>

<p>“You should have told us!” pouted the young wives,
darting angry glances at Rosalind, who, seeing the
game was all up, cleared her throat and said angrily,
defiantly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[260]</span></p>

<p>“Take your hands off me, sirs; I shall not touch
the little liar. I am only going to say that I admit
everything, and am only sorry I did not kill both her
and Charley in the bear pit.”</p>

<p>Her blue eyes blazed fury, and Senator Bonair cried
wrathfully:</p>

<p>“I shall be forever grateful to Berenice for unmasking
you and saving me from a detested marriage. Now
go to your lover; we must be rid of you as soon as
possible!”</p>

<p>“Would you send me away penniless?” cried Rosalind,
angry and humiliated at the utter failure of her
schemes. “I sold my jewels to come to you, and my
lover is a poor man!”</p>

<p>The senator plucked a great roll of bills from his
pocket and tossed them at her feet.</p>

<p>“There are three thousand dollars. It is the price
of never seeing your face again,” he thundered. “Now
go and leave us to the happiness of a reunited family!”</p>

<p>She snatched up the money and the lace gown and
rushed from the room. Three days later she and
Adrian Vance appeared before Mrs. Brander, in Paris.</p>

<p>“We are married and settled in Paris,” she announced
calmly. “Old Moneybags was so homely, with
his smallpox scars, that I threw him over and married<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
my poor, handsome Adrian. I have written to mamma,
but I fear she will never forgive us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brander thought it all very strange, but later
on the truth leaked out, and she knew the false beauty
for what she really was&mdash;a reckless, disappointed
schemer.</p>

<p>But Charley Bonair did not learn all that happened
until many days after, when his convalescence was an
assured thing and he could hear, without danger to his
health, the happy news that Rosalind had been banished
in disgrace, and that the senator had reinstated him in
his good graces, and given the Washington palace to
Berenice as a wedding gift.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TROUBLE BEGINS AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Charley had fully recovered, he and his lovely
young wife decided to go to England where the first
part of their married life had flowed along on mingled
currents of joy and sorrow. They hoped to revisit
the happier scenes; and, moreover, Charley had still
another motive in returning. News had reached Senator
Bonair that an old English estate was for sale; and,
in the full tide of rejoicing over his deliverance from
Rosalind, and his pride in his “united family,” he offered
to buy the estate for his son.</p>

<p>“No, it’s too much for you to do for me, dad!” exclaimed
Charley, when the astounding proposition was
made. “I don’t deserve such generosity!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” was his father’s laconic answer. “But
if I’m of the opinion that you do&mdash;well, that should
be sufficient. What do <em>you</em> say, Berry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know I think nothing is too good for
Charley!” answered Berry, with a smile. “But, of
course, we both appreciate how dear and generous you
are.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed the senator. “I confess I myself
have a desire for this Erda estate, but, as I have all<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
I can manage, with my duties in Washington and my
country seat in California, I’m quite willing to buy this
estate for Charles, if he wishes to join the ranks of
the American-English ‘landed gentry.’”</p>

<p>Charles was more than willing, as his father knew.
He was also profoundly grateful for his father’s generosity
in making such a gift, which was all the more
impressive as it was destined to be the last.</p>

<p>Hardly had the negotiations for the sale been completed,
and the Erda estate came into Charles Bonair’s
proud possession, when the senator, whose health had
for some time been failing, fell seriously ill. All
that the best English physicians could do proved unavailing;
for, after a brief illness, he died, and was
taken to America for burial near his beautiful California
estate.</p>

<p>When Charles and his wife finally returned to England,
after this sad interruption of their plans, they
found surprising news awaiting them at Crumplesea,
a summer resort near Thetford Towers, as the Erda
estate was called. The news was conveyed in a letter
from Rosalind, who had not even had the grace to
send condolences to any of the Bonair family.</p>

<p>It was addressed to Berry, and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You may, or may not, be surprised to know that
my husband is your stepbrother, Adrian Vance. He<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
informed me of this fact not long ago, indeed before
we were married, but I found I loved him well enough
to forgive his humble ancestry, even though in marrying
him I was forced to claim kinship with you! We
are, therefore, by stretching a point, sisters-in-law, and
it is quite likely that, after all, we may meet again.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I hope not!” said Berry, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Amen to that!” answered Charles. “But we seem
to be fated to meet that woman, in one way or another,
wherever we go! I wonder how she found
out that we are here?”</p>

<p>“She must have seen, in the newspapers, notices of
the sale of Thetford Towers.”</p>

<p>“Of course! And probably she will expect us to
ask them to visit us, in her new capacity as sister-in-law!
Oh, she is quite capable of that! Especially
now that father is dead. Well, she will be woefully
disappointed, if <em>we</em> have anything to say about it!”</p>

<p>Berry smiled. “We may have less to say than we
think, dear; the matter may be taken quite out of
our hands by Rosalind herself. I foresee trouble. Another
thing: Adrian is a mere adventurer, a gambler,
and if he married her only for her money, how long
do you suppose that will last?”</p>

<p>“What a worldly-wise little pessimist you are, dear!”
responded Charles, with a laugh. “Come, tear up this<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
insulting troublesome letter, and let’s drive over to the
Towers. What’s the use of vexing ourselves with a
mere chance that may not occur for a dozen years?”</p>

<p>This easy-going philosophy proved to be the wrong
one, for they heard again from Rosalind, two years
later. This time it was to announce the birth of a
daughter, who was to be named Dora. Why Rosalind
had taken the trouble to send this announcement to
the Bonairs, in spite of their continued indifference to
her existence, was not clear to Berry, who merely remarked:
“I suppose she has reasons of her own.”
But Charles saw through this move clearly enough. He
readily guessed that Rosalind and her husband had not
given up hope of being received at Thetford Towers;
all the more now, for the sake of their daughter,
Berry’s niece, and also because their fortunes were
known to be on the wane.</p>

<p>His understanding was aided by reports of Adrian’s
reckless speculations which he had heard from time
to time, during his occasional visits in London.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, he had, unknown to
Berry, received a letter from Adrian Vance, requesting
the loan of a large sum of money with which to
pay several importunate creditors; and he had even
gone so far as to lend Adrian half the amount, hoping
thereby to avoid further difficulties with the Vance<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
family. In this hope he was destined to be disappointed;
for Adrian suddenly appeared at Thetford
Towers, early in the following summer, and sought an
interview with Charles and Berry.</p>

<p>The meeting was not pleasant to any of the three.
Charles was frankly indignant, Berry cool and reserved,
Adrian in a tumult of embarrassment, envy,
and resentment.</p>

<p>“Rosalind is well, I dare say,” he said, in answer to
their perfunctory question. “I’ve not seen her for
several months. She’s studying to go on the stage&mdash;you’ll
have her again for a rival, Berry, in your former
sphere.”</p>

<p>The covert insolence of this seemingly playful remark
was not lost upon its hearers, who took no notice
of it, however, and soon afterward managed to bring
the interview to a close. Adrian departed, no richer
than he had come.</p>

<p>Before the end of the summer, he was killed in a
railroad accident on the Continent, and Rosalind, the
heiress whom he had reduced to poverty and driven to
the stage, left the country, and was not again seen in
England for many years. When she returned to trouble
and harass her “relatives,” it was in an unexpected
and disgraceful way.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">IN NEW GUISE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Years passed, fourteen happy and uneventful years,
during most of which the Bonairs lived quietly on their
English estate, among their friends in England and
from America. Charles’ sisters, Lucile and Marie,
with their families, spent alternate summers at Thetford
Towers, or traveling on the Continent, while during
the winters the Bonairs fled to California.</p>

<p>One day, in early summer, Berry intended to drive
over to Crumplesea, in her motor car, to say good-by
to her old friends, the Westons, who were leaving the
next morning. Willis Weston had married a charming
American heiress years ago, and had become one
of the leading dramatists and managers of America.</p>

<p>Charles was absent from England, at this time, having
gone to New York on business which would detain
him there.</p>

<p>It was a perfect summer day, warm and sunny, and
Berry could not help feeling happy and secure from
trouble or harm. But as in every life, clouds sometimes
gather on the horizon and overshadow it for a while;
so now, had she only known it, another storm was
impending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[268]</span></p>

<p>The first sign thereof was a slight mishap which
brought the motor car to a standstill halfway on the
road to Crumplesea.</p>

<p>Berry, who was somewhat of a fatalist in her way,
always declared that the thing was foreordained. Mellish,
chauffeur, simply said&mdash;sotto voce, of course&mdash;that
it was “cursed bad luck, though no more than
he had expected when Mrs. Bonair would have the
car out to-day, after she’d been told that it ought to
be sent to the garage yesterday, and she might just
as well have used the victoria as not.”</p>

<p>The facts of the case may be related in a few words:
The motor car had come up over the brow of the hill
on its way back from Thetford Towers, and was rolling
sedately through the drowsy stillness of Crumplesea,
when a sharp metallic “zing-g-g!” sounded, and
off came the tire of the left forewheel. Crumplesea
boasted of three hotels and no end of “apartments,”
but it could only lay claim to one garage, at the other
end of the town, close to where the new hall&mdash;dignified
by the name of opera house&mdash;had recently been
erected. Mellish, who had learned this fact from the
small gathering of idlers which the accident had collected&mdash;and
to whom Berry was known, by sight and
by name, about as well as the town clock itself&mdash;imparted<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
the knowledge to his mistress, and was rather
surprised that she took it with such equanimity.</p>

<p>“Very well, send for the man and have the thing
set right at once,” she said. “It is only a step to the
Crumplesea Hotel, and I dare say that Mercy Blint
can manage to make me comfortable and get me a cup
of tea while I am waiting. You can come back there
for me when the tire has been put on again. But don’t
be any longer than is absolutely necessary; I want to
get home before dark, if possible!”</p>

<p>And then with the utmost serenity she alighted and
walked straightway to the Crumplesea Hotel, which establishment
was run by a woman who had once been
her maid, and who, on the occasion of her marriage
with the under butler, had been pensioned off some
years ago.</p>

<p>Inquiry brought forth the intelligence that Mercy
herself was absent for the day, but Mercy’s husband
was there, and himself showed her ladyship into what
was known as the coffee room&mdash;every other room in
the house being engaged at the time&mdash;and rushed away
in person to get tea for her.</p>

<p>And here it was that Berry saw another sign of
trouble&mdash;the glaring, brightly colored aggressively
prominent sign which always made her think that to-day’s
accident had been foreordained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[270]</span></p>

<p>It took the shape of a bill announcing the forthcoming
opening of the new Crumplesea Opera House,
when&mdash;to quote the announcement verbatim&mdash;“Mr.
Milton Dante’s celebrated company of London artists
would present the world-famous musical play, ‘The
Beauty of Gotham,’ headed by the gifted and beautiful
American actress and prima donna, Miss Rosalind
Montague-Vance.”</p>

<p>A slow pallor, creeping like a snail, came steadily
down over Berry’s face as she saw that bill. She stood
for a long time looking fixedly at the printed words
and not saying one word, not making one sound.</p>

<p>So she was still standing when, some twenty minutes
later, her tea was brought into her by the obsequious
Blint himself.</p>

<p>She sat down and drank the tea and ate the buttered
toast she had ordered, and then rang the bell and called
the man back to the room.</p>

<p>“Blint,” she said, pointing to the bill hanging upon
the wall, “have those people come to Crumplesea as
yet? I see they are advertised to open the new hall
next Thursday. Have they come here yet?”</p>

<p>“No, my lady, not yet, of course; it’s best part of a
week until Thursday. The advance agent will be here
to-morrow, though, to make arrangements for rooms
and the like. Hamer&mdash;him as runs the Cliff Hotel, as<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
you may remember, seeing that he’s a tenant of yours&mdash;got
word to that effect this afternoon, and come over
to see if I’d any rooms vacant; him not being able to
put up the whole party.”</p>

<p>Berry pushed back her empty teacup, and rose.</p>

<p>“See that they don’t get any, then,” she said, in a
singularly dry voice. “See that every room in every
hotel in the place is engaged for me. I don’t care
what it costs, I want them all. Engage them for me.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, ma’am, but&mdash;but can you really
mean it?”</p>

<p>“Am I in the habit of saying things that I do not
mean? I see that they are billed to appear for three
nights. Take all the vacant rooms in all the hotels for
that period, in my name. Shut them out of every
accommodation and force them to go elsewhere, if you
can, and that woman, above all!”</p>

<p>The man gave a nervous start and looked as though
he had received a shock.</p>

<p>“My lady!” he said, with a frightened look.
“Heaven preserve us! it’s not her? It’s never the&mdash;the
Yankee woman who married your&mdash;your brother,
Mr. Vance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. I never want to see her, but I recognize
the name; as Mercy would have done, had she been
at home. Now go and do what I have told you, and<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
see that the woman finds no place to stop here. If you
think the manager of the hall can be bought to cancel
the engagement of the company&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not possible, my lady; the thing was arranged
months ago.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for me, then. However, I’ll do
what I can. Go and engage every vacant room you
can hear of, and go at once, please.”</p>

<p>Blint, in a state of shaking nervousness, flew to obey,
and when, half an hour afterward, he came back to announce
that he had done as he had been bidden, he
found the repaired motor car at the door and her ladyship
sitting in it.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, as Blint came back with the
list of the rooms he had engaged in her name. “Reckon
up the sum total and I will send you a check for the
amount. Home, Mellish.”</p>

<p>And then the motor car swung out into the roadway
and rolled off through the fast deepening Kentish dusk.</p>

<p>And this was how it was that when Mr. Milton
Dante’s advance agent came down to Crumplesea to arrange
accommodations for the company, he found
every available inch of room in the several hotels engaged
for a week to come.</p>

<p>“Company’ll have to go into apartments, that’s all,”<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
he said, in his airy, offhand way to Mr. Bodwin, the
proprietor and manager of the newly erected Crumplesea
Opera House. “Dante won’t like that, of course,
for he’s struck a rich thing in getting the provincial
rights to the ‘Beauty of Gotham,’ and he’s putting on
no end of side, and insisting on all the members of the
company putting up at hotels, instead of lodging houses
and the like. It’s hard on some of ’em&mdash;especially the
low-salaried ‘utility people’&mdash;but he’s in a position to
dictate, and it’s that or nothing for most of ’em, poor
devils! I dare say there’ll be many of ’em who’ll be as
pleased as Punch over the mishap; but if the Montague
doesn’t raise the roof, when she learns that she
will have to go into apartments, you can write me
down as an ass.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! is she a very violent person, then?”
queried the manager apprehensively. “We are a very
circumspect people here in Crumplesea, Mr. Billet, although
the place is gaining renown as a seaside resort,
and you quite alarm me with these hints.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let that worry you. She won’t be in the
town twenty-four hours before every man in it is gone
on her and willing to swear that she’s the sweetest thing
that ever happened. If ever she manages to get a
hearing in London&mdash;and she will yet; she’s not the
kind of woman to be kept in the provinces forever&mdash;somebody’s<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
title will come her way, I warrant you.
And it won’t be a mere empty title, either; it will be
one well backed up with capital&mdash;trust her for that!
She’s a highflyer, and she comes from a country where
they know how to get full value for everything. Wait
till she gets to London, that’s all. She’s not too old
to hook a fish worth landing, even yet.”</p>

<p>“How old is she, Mr. Billet?”</p>

<p>“Ask me something easier! On the stage she looks
about twenty, on the street about&mdash;oh, well, I’m too
old a hand at this business to be caught belying the
posters,” returned Mr. Billet, with a laugh and a wink.
“But look here; draw your own conclusions. She
owns up to five and twenty, and when a woman does
that&mdash;especially a woman in the theatrical profession&mdash;you
can safely add anything from five to ten to her
figures, and not feel that you are doing her any injustice.
Now then, show me the way to the post office,
will you? I want to send a wire to Dante to prepare
him for this little muddle about the accommodations;
and, look here, Mr. Bodwin! take a fool’s advice and
don’t you waste your time in going off your head over
fair Rosalind when you see her&mdash;though, I dare say,
you will, for all that; she seems born to make men do it
wherever she goes&mdash;but just remember that you
haven’t the ghost of a chance; and wouldn’t have if you<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
owned all Crumplesea. Remember, I have warned
you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but it is useless warning. I am already
a married man.”</p>

<p>Mr. Billet looked up into his face, and laughed.</p>

<p>“So was Anthony,” he said. “Now come and show
me the way to the post office.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The curtain had fallen upon the close of the second
act of “The Beauty of Gotham,” and Miss Montague-Vance
had disappeared for the nonce from the enraptured
gaze of Oakhampton&mdash;it was at the Oakhampton
Theater that the company was appearing to-night&mdash;when
Mr. Milton Dante&mdash;his baptismal certificate
read “Peter Burridge,” by the way&mdash;came round behind
the scenes in a state of angry excitement and
rapped loudly upon Miss Montague-Vance’s dressing-room
door.</p>

<p>“It’s me&mdash;Milt,” he said, in the quiet original grammar
of his native Battersea. “I’ve got something to
show you. Can I come in?”</p>

<p>“No. If it’s anything important, just wait five minutes
and I’ll be out.”</p>

<p>The five minutes passed and the door opened, and
out of it issued a creature so lovely, that even Mr.<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
Milton Dante&mdash;who ought by this time to be used to
it, Heaven knows&mdash;felt a little thrill as the vision
dawned upon him.</p>

<p>“Scotland! but you do look scrummy to-night!” he
said admiringly.</p>

<p>“Never mind how I look,” returned “the vision,”
with an exceedingly earthy air. “You didn’t come here
to pay me silly compliments, I fancy; or if you did,
you are wasting your time and mine, to no purpose.
What is it you want to say to me? Is it anything nice,
or the reverse?”</p>

<p>“The reverse, I’m afraid. Our next ‘stand’ is
Crumplesea, and the company will have to go into
apartments when we get there.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, it won’t; at least I won’t. None of your
seaside apartments for me, if you please! Let others
do what they like&mdash;or what you like; I suppose it
amounts to that&mdash;but I want the best hotel in the
place.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid we can’t get in. Billet has just
wired me that every hotel in the place is engaged by
some old fool of a woman called Mrs. Bonair, and that&mdash;I
say! great Scott! are you ill? Thunder! you’re
as white as a ghost.”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I am or what I am not,” she
answered, in a singularly hard and singularly uneven<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
voice. “So that woman has heard of my coming and
has tried like this to shut me out, has she?”</p>

<p>“What woman? What the dickens are you talking
about? And I say, whatever has come over you?
I expected you to raise the roof and to shy things
when you heard of this, and I’m blessed if you’re not
taking it as meek as Moses.”</p>

<p>“No, not quite so meek&mdash;as you will learn before
this affair is over. So that woman is going to try
to shut me out, is she? Well, it will be a bad day’s
work for her&mdash;I promise you that. I would have let
her alone if she had been sensible and let me alone.
But she chooses to show her claws, and so I’ll show
mine.”</p>

<p>“Who the dickens are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“About this woman, this Mrs. Bonair, who is going
to try the trick of shutting me out of Crumplesea.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! do you know her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know her&mdash;and what’s more, she shall
know me in a few days, and better than she ever knew
me before in her life. Look here, here’s something
for you to know about me as well&mdash;I’ve a daughter.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ve often wondered where I sent so much
of my salary, and now you know. I’ve a daughter
who’s nearly sixteen years old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>“The dickens you say! It can’t be true.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and what’s more, it is. She’s at school,
and I haven’t seen her&mdash;no, and haven’t wanted to,
either&mdash;since she was old enough to walk alone. I’m
going to see her now, however, and Mrs. Bonair is
going to see her, too&mdash;see her and hear of her for the
first time. Shut me out, will she? Show her claws
like that, eh, after I’ve let her alone for all these
years? Well, if ever&mdash;get out of the way, for goodness’
sake! That’s the curtain bell, and that little
beast of a call boy never notified me that it was time
to begin.”</p>

<p>And then, without another word, she turned and
ran up the stairs to the stage as fast as her little satin-shod
feet could go.</p>

<p>“Fifteen, love,” said Dora mechanically, as she jotted
down the score. “No, I beg pardon, it isn’t; it’s fifteen
all.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” snapped her pet aversion,
Gwen Morley, turning on her with a flash of angry resentment.
“You’re not paying attention. It’s thirty,
fifteen; that last ball was a fault, if it’s all the same
to you, Miss Vance, and our side had scored a point
before that. It’s thirty, fifteen, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Dora&mdash;she made a point of
never bandying words with Gwen Morley. “If it is
thirty, fifteen, I’ll set it down that way. No doubt I
made a mistake; my head aches. Go on with the
game, please, and I will try to keep the score properly&mdash;if
I can.”</p>

<p>“If you can? Well, I like that! What are you here
for? I don’t suppose Miss Skimmers sent you out here
to twiddle your thumbs and look at the sky, although
that’s about all you have done since we started playing.
If you can’t keep the score correctly, say so, and we’ll
get some other gifted and condescending pupil teacher
to do it for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[280]</span></p>

<p>Dora swallowed the affront with no more outward
show of her feelings than a slight heightening of her
color, and presently the white balls were skimming
over the tennis net and flying through the hot, still
air again.</p>

<p>But if she said nothing, she thought a great deal, and
the term “pupil teacher” rankled, though why it should
have done so&mdash;unless it was because of the sneering
tone in which it had been spoken&mdash;she could not tell.
For a pupil teacher she undoubtedly was, and had been
for this many a long day.</p>

<p>“It is your mother’s desire that, as she cannot afford
to give you the full advantages enjoyed by more
fortunate pupils, you should do something yourself
to assist in paying for your education,” explained Miss
Skimmers, with something of a sneer, when Dora was
old enough and advanced enough to enter upon this
stage of her existence. “You will divide your time in
future between receiving lessons and in imparting them.
You are quite advanced enough now to teach the little
children of the third form, and I will write and tell
your mother so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, do, please,” Dora had said, when she was
told this. “If my mother is poor, Miss Skimmers&mdash;and
I suppose from what you say, she must be&mdash;I don’t
want to be a drag on her, and I should like very much<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
to do something to help pay for my education. But
what is my mother? You see, I was such a little
thing when I first came here that I don’t remember
living anywhere else or belonging to any one else, and
I thought&mdash;oh, Miss Skimmers, I didn’t know until
this minute that I belonged to anybody or had a single
relation in the world. But a mother! How delightful!
Have I a father, too?”</p>

<p>“No; I was told that your mother was a widow
when you were brought to me; a widow in good circumstances
was how the man&mdash;he claimed to be her
solicitor&mdash;who brought you here put it, and I was not
undeceived until a year later, when she wrote me to
the contrary, and said that, when you were old enough,
she desired you to do something toward reducing the
expenses of your education.”</p>

<p>Casting back her memory, when she heard this, Dora
could readily guess when that time was; for she had a
distinct recollection of coming suddenly&mdash;and for some
reason unexplained at the time&mdash;down from the giddy
eminence of “show pupil,” who was trotted out to be
exhibited whenever a possible new client made his or
her appearance, to the undignified position of something
that ought to be&mdash;and was&mdash;kept in the background
and translated from the splendors of a bedroom
on the first floor to one that had broken furniture<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
and discolored walls and nothing but a thin layer
of leaky slates between it and heaven. She had suffered
in that upper-story bedroom&mdash;suffered agonies
of heat in summer and tortures of cold in winter, and
the dread of scurrying plaster-disturbing rats at all
seasons, whether hot or cold&mdash;but it all sank into insignificance
now before the glory of having a mother.</p>

<p>“Who is my mother?” she asked of Miss Skimmers,
in the gladness of her heart and the joy of finding
that she possessed such a glorious thing. “Where is
she? What is she? Oh, tell me, please.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” Miss Skimmers answered,
as she shrugged her shoulders and walked
away. “All my dealings with her have been through
a third party. But she is evidently not a person of
my class or the class and standing of my other patrons.”</p>

<p>And considering that Miss Skimmers’ parents had
been in the green-grocer line, and that her pupils were
the daughters of successful drapers, butchers, milliners,
and publicans, Dora was rather glad to hear it.</p>

<p>In some strange indefinable way she felt herself of
a different clay from the rest of Miss Skimmers’ pupils,
and held herself aloof from them. And they felt it,
too, and hated her for it, hardly knowing why&mdash;only
that she always reminded them of a rose in a bed of<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
dandelions, and, try as they would to remember that
the dandelions were gifted with the hue of gold, they
could not forget that they were little, undersized,
glaring, stiff-stalked, piggish, close-to-the-earth things
and that the rose was always the rose, and that it was
nature’s law that it should hold its head above them
and be a nobler flower than they.</p>

<p>For a time, the knowledge that she had a mother
somewhere in the world filled Dora with a sense of a
joy that was sufficient in itself, and she used to lie
awake nights and dream of the time when that wonderful
mother would come and take her away, or
perhaps call in the mid-term just to see her, as the
other girls’ mothers sometimes did. But as the weeks
and the months and the years rolled by and brought
no realization of the dream, it died slowly down into
the dead level of her daily life and was forgotten entirely&mdash;or
if not actually forgotten, at least laid away,
as children lay away the fables and the fairy tales of
the nursery when they have grown too old to believe
in them as possible things.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any truth in it; it was all a ‘make-believe’
of Miss Skimmers, and I haven’t any mother at
all,” she said to herself whenever the phantom of
that dead hope came back to haunt her. “If I had,
she would not have left me so utterly alone for all<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
these years&mdash;it isn’t human. She will never come&mdash;I
know it now&mdash;because she doesn’t exist. I seem fated
to pass my life enduring the cold insolence of brewers’
daughters, like Gwen Morley, and the sneers of people
like Miss Skimmers. I won’t, however. I’ll get out
of it all, as soon as I am old enough to go away, and
I’ll earn my living and make a place for myself in the
world, somehow.”</p>

<p>That had been her determination months and months
ago, she was thinking of it now as she sat, a dreary,
shabby, spiritless figure, in the grounds of Miss Skimmers’
“School for Young Ladies,” and watched the
tennis balls fly to and fro through the hot, still air of
the summer afternoon.</p>

<p>The hot sun beating down upon her made her head
ache, and the glare of the white dresses of the tennis
players hurt her eyes; even the whistling of a thrush
in a near-by tree seemed to irritate her to-day, and
the loud laughter of the girls was positively maddening.
But she kept on with the distasteful task of
umpiring the match, and said never a word, until suddenly
a shadow lengthened across the grass, fell upon
her score book, and made her look up. Then she saw
that one of the housemaids was standing beside her,
and became conscious that the girl was saying something
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[285]</span></p>

<p>“You will have to get some one else to umpire for
a time,” she said, as she rose from her seat and laid
the score book down beside Gwen Morley. “Miss
Skimmers has sent word that she wants to see me at
once.”</p>

<p>She was unspeakably glad to get out of the heat and
the blinding glare of the sun, and she walked away
instantly, going straight to the cool, shadowy, little
room where Miss Skimmers passed her hours of relaxation,
and where the maid had told her that lady
was waiting for her.</p>

<p>She opened the door and walked in&mdash;wondering the
while what she was going to be taken to task for now;
a summons to Miss Skimmers’ presence usually meaning
that. She was not at all surprised when she beheld
that large plethoric female pacing the room in
a state of violent excitement and wheezing like an
asthmatical dragon.</p>

<p>“Shameful, I call it, Miss Vance!” she blurted out,
without any preface, as Dora came into the room.
“After all the sacrifices I have made for you, after
all the consideration I have shown you both! And in
the middle of the term, too, without a word of notice
or a chance to supply the vacancy”&mdash;her voice rising
to a sort of shriek, as she flung her unwieldy body
about the room. “Shameful, I call it; outrageous, I<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
call it, and wanting in all respect, all decency, all consideration
for me.”</p>

<p>“If you will tell me what all this is the prelude to,
Miss Skimmers, perhaps I shall be able to understand
what you mean,” said Dora, in that calm, low, reposeful
voice, which was one of nature’s birth gifts to her,
and which even fourteen years in the Skimmers’ establishment
had not been able to destroy. “Will you
tell me, please, what has happened and let me draw
my own conclusions with regard to what you are
pleased to term the ‘shamefulness’ of it; I suppose it
has something to do with me, or you would not have
sent for me.”</p>

<p>“It has everything to do with you,” cried Miss
Skimmers, in what Dora, in unholy moments of secret
mirth, was wont to call her “here’s your fine cauliflowers
and nice fresh radishes” voice. “It has everything
to do with you and with that inconsiderate person,
your mother.”</p>

<p>“My mother? Let us leave that phantom out of the
matter, Miss Skimmers. I am eighteen years of age&mdash;or
I shall be in a month&mdash;and it is hardly complimentary
to my intelligence to expect me to have faith in
fairy tales now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Miss Skimmers.
“You were always a queer girl, and I never could understand<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
you. I dare say that your mother is like
you, or she wouldn’t be treating me in this shameful
way and sending for you in the middle of the term
and not giving me a moment’s notice to get some one
to fill your place.”</p>

<p>Dora’s head swam and she staggered a little as
though the heat had overcome her.</p>

<p>“My mother,” she said faintly. “You say that my
mother has sent for&mdash;oh, Miss Skimmers, are you
losing your senses or am I? My mother? Mine? She
exists? And has sent for me? Oh, Miss Skimmers,
is it really true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is; and very uncommon shabby of her I call
it, too&mdash;sending for you like this, and not giving me
time to fill your place. Here’s her letter, if you want
to see it. She’s stopping at a place called Minorca
Villa, in Crumplesea, on the Kentish coast, and she
writes that you’re to go to her there at once, and not
to delay a moment in starting. And here’s a five-pound
note she inclosed for you to get a new frock and to pay
your railway ticket, and here’s a card, too, with the address
on it, ‘Minorca Villa, Nightingale Road, Crumplesea,
Kent.’”</p>

<p>Dora took both the letter and the card, read each&mdash;in
a state of blissful excitement&mdash;and then took possession
of the five-pound note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>“To think of my mother being a really existing
person!” she said, with a happy little laugh. “Oh,
Miss Skimmers, I can scarcely believe it. I shall go
at once, at once.”</p>

<p>She was as good as her word. Within the space of
half an hour, she had packed her small belongings
into a shabby valise&mdash;a relic of her “first-floor” days&mdash;sent
them over to the railway station by a housemaid,
said good-by to the house cat, her only friend and
companion in the dreary days she was leaving behind
her, and had shaken the dust of the Skimmers’ establishment
from her feet forever.</p>

<p>The day no longer seemed hot and suffocating, and
the sun no longer hurt her eyes as she walked down
the dusty, glaring, treeless road to the railway station&mdash;she
was going to her mother, that poor, sorely
tried, wonderful mother, who was an existent, after
all, and whose poverty had kept them so long apart.
For by some strange process of reasoning which was
not compatible with the facts of the case, she had arrived
at the conclusion that poverty was the sole explanation
of her mother’s long neglect of her.</p>

<p>“Poor little mother!” she thought, as she hurried
out; “it took all she could spare to pay for my education,
of course, and she could not afford to waste
money in coming to see me. What a dear she is to<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
have done so much! But never mind, I’ll make it all
up to you, and there will be two now to fight the battle,
and as the proverb says, ‘Many hands make light work.’
I can teach music, and no end of things, and&mdash;you’ll
see!&mdash;it won’t be long before I find pupils and am in a
position to give you a nice little home and at least
some of the comforts a lady should have.”</p>

<p>For, of course, her mother was a lady; there could
be no possible doubt of that, considering that in the
old days she had had her affairs attended to by a
family solicitor and was spoken of as a person of considerable
importance&mdash;a lady in reduced circumstances,
it is true, but still a lady. In her mind’s eye, Dora
could almost see her already&mdash;a sweet-faced, sweet-voiced
motherly old lady with gray hair and mild eyes;
a dear, soft-treading, soft-speaking, gentle old darling,
with a tiny white cap on her head and such beautiful
shapely old hands.</p>

<p>“How I shall love her; how I shall love her!” said
the girl, with a little rush of happy tears; then she
laughed aloud in her happiness, and, catching sight of
the station at last, quickened her steps, until she was
almost running when she finally entered it. Going up
to the ticket office, she purchased her ticket.</p>

<p>“Have to change at Morecome Junction,” said the
clerk, in answer to her query; “and if you catch the<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
connection, you ought to be at Crumplesea about six-forty.
If you miss it, you’ll have to stop at Morecome
the night; there’s no other trains to Crumplesea
until the morning. Train for Morecome’s coming in
now.</p>

<p>“Number four platform&mdash;and you’ll have to step
lively if you want to catch it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Dora, as she gathered up her
ticket and the change. In another moment, she was
flying down the stairs to the train and to the beginning
of the strange new life that lay before her.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>For once, in a way, fortune favored Dora. She
managed to catch the connecting train at Morecome
Junction, and, as a consequence, arrived at Crumplesea&mdash;tired
and dusty, but still full of enthusiasm&mdash;at
a quarter to seven that same evening.</p>

<p>It was the night of the opening of the Crumplesea
Opera House, and she found the whole town placarded
with gaudy posters of “The Beauty of Gotham”&mdash;glaring,
highly colored things, depicting women with impossible
tresses of an impossible shade of yellow, frisking
about in skirts above their knees.</p>

<p>But in that first glance she had seen the name, “Miss
Rosalind Montague-Vance,” emblazoned over the boldest
and the most conspicuous of them all, and she
had felt an added shame because of that.</p>

<p>Not that she had any idea that the bearer of it could
be in any way, even the remotest, connected with herself&mdash;for
there were hundreds of “Vances” in the
world; even Miss Skimmers having had more than
one of them enrolled among her pupils in Dora’s time&mdash;but
that the knowledge of there being a woman bearing
a name the same as her own, who could let her pictures<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
be shown in public, made the shame of it seem a personal
matter.</p>

<p>“How it must shock poor little mother, if she has
seen it, too,” she said to herself. “Fancy having one’s
name flaunted about by a creature like that, and in the
very town where one lives! It must be awful.”</p>

<p>The change of the five-pound note that had been sent
her was still in her pocket&mdash;there had not been time to
stop anywhere and buy the new frock she had been
told to do&mdash;and hastily summoning a cabman to her
aid, she gave him the necessary directions, and was
soon speeding away to Minorca Villa with her shabby
old valise on the top of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Her destination was a rather shabby little brick house
in a side street&mdash;there were such things as “apartments”
to be had in Crumplesea, and all the available
ones were engaged for Mr. Milton Dante’s company&mdash;and
here at this flat-fronted, dejected-looking little
building, Dora’s long journey from Miss Skimmers’
seat of learning came to an end.</p>

<p>“Come in, miss,” said the landlady&mdash;who opened
the door in person. “The maid, she’s away&mdash;’aving
been sent a’ errand by your sweet ma. You’re Miss
Montague-Vance’s daughter, of course; anybody could
see that at a glance, for you’re the livin’ image of ’er.
’Ere, Sarah! come and take the young lady’s luggage<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
and carry it up to the room Miss Montague-Vance
selected for ’er. Come in, miss; your sweet ma, she’s
awaitin’ of yer&mdash;’aving but recent come back from a
drive round the town with Mr. Bodwin, as owns the
opera ’ouse, and Mr. Dante, as runs the company.”</p>

<p>All this was Greek to Dora. As a matter of fact,
she hardly heard it, for her mind was in a whirl between
settling with the cabman and realizing that she
was now under the same roof with her unknown
mother. She scarcely knew what was said or done,
until she was led down a short and narrow passage,
and the woman beside her was knocking at the door
before which they both stood.</p>

<p>“The young lady, mum,” said the woman, as, in answer
to a nonchalant, “Come in,” she turned the knob,
and, letting a strong odor of Turkish cigarettes stream
out into the passage, thrust open the door, “the young
lady, mum, and I’m a-showin’ of ’er straight in like
you asked.”</p>

<p>Dora waited for nothing more.</p>

<p>“Mother!” she said, with a little throb in her voice
as she pressed past the landlady and entered the room,
shutting the door behind her.</p>

<p>It seemed so holy, this meeting for the first time
since infancy with the mother who had borne her!
“It is I; it is Dora; it is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[294]</span></p>

<p>Here she stopped. The room was full of smoke, and
through the dense aromatic cloud, she saw a figure
curled up in a deep armchair beside a table littered
with papers, magazines, and cigarette ashes&mdash;a figure
clad in a beautiful lace tea gown, and with a lovely,
alluring face framed in a loose mass of disheveled
wine-gold hair.</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg your pardon,” said Dora, coloring
and instinctively fumbling for the knob of the door.
“Such an absurd mistake. Pray forgive me; the fault
was not mine. I expected to find my mother here.”</p>

<p>“Well, so you have done. If you are Dora&mdash;and
what an absurdly big creature you have grown! I am
your mother.”</p>

<p>“You? Absurd! Oh, pardon me, I don’t mean to
be rude, but really this is too silly. You can’t be
more than a year or two older than I am myself&mdash;and
I am nearly eighteen years of age.”</p>

<p>“Nearly sixteen, please; I’ve told Dante that, and
we may as well stick to it. It’s bad enough to have
to confess that I’m old enough to have a daughter
nearly sixteen, without adding two years to it, for
the sake of truth. What in the world has made you
grow like this? Of course, I know that your father
was tall, but if I had thought that you were as big
and as old-looking as you are, I don’t believe I should<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
had have courage enough to send to that Skimmers
woman for you&mdash;although I don’t know; it’s worth
something to have a dig at your aunt! What are you
staring at me like this for? For pity’s sake, sit down.
Why didn’t you get a new dress? I sent money for you
to do so. But perhaps the Skimmers woman didn’t
give it to you? Did she? Why don’t you answer?
I hate people who stare and say nothing. Sit down
and talk to me, for goodness’ sake. I haven’t much
time to waste with you, anyway; I’ve got to be off
to the theater in a few minutes. I’m opening the
new opera house to-night, you know&mdash;or, perhaps,
you don’t know! But the town is well billed, and if
you have any eyes at all you must have seen my name
on the boardings.”</p>

<p>Dora drew back with a sudden influx of memory
and with a shuddering sense of repulsion. “Oh, you
don’t mean&mdash;you can’t mean that you&mdash;you are that
woman? And that you are my mother as well?”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I mean it? Look here! that Skimmers
woman hasn’t raised you like some Puritanical old
granny, has she? I’m going to put you on the stage,
you know, and have a ‘go’ at your spiteful aunt, in
that way. She always treated her brother and me very
shabbily. I don’t suppose you ever heard much about
your father? Well, he was the unfortunate stepbrother<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
to the richest woman in this part of the country:
Mrs. Charles Bonair. He’s dead, by the way,
so you won’t be worried by him. Although I wrote
her, she wouldn’t give a farthing to me. Stingy old
cat! I told her about you&mdash;oh, make no mistake about
that&mdash;and I’ll make her pay dear for what she has
tried to do against me in this town. She would not
let sleeping dogs lie, and now that she has waked ’em
up, she’ll have to pay the price for it, if I know myself.”</p>

<p>Something that was like the pressure of a strong
hand gripped Dora’s throat. She did not speak; she
could not&mdash;all strength, mental as well as physical,
seemed somehow to have died within her, and, in a sort
of collapse, she sank down on the edge of a convenient
seat, and stared dumbly at the shining figure
before her; a sense of shuddering repulsion biting into
her soul and mirroring itself, in spite of her, in her
fixed eyes. For, somehow, this woman, her newly
found mother, reminded her of a snake curled up in
rose leaves.</p>

<p>“Don’t stare at me like that or I shall throw something
at you, in a minute!” blazed wrathfully the object
of her attention, reading that look and starting
suddenly up in a temper. “I can see how it is: you
hate me. No; don’t trouble yourself to tell a polite lie&mdash;that<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
sort of thing is wasted on me&mdash;and besides, the
sentiment is reciprocated. I think I never saw a more
ill-favored, unlovable creature in my life! It positively
makes me ill to look at you, with your way of
looking at people as though they were dirt beneath
your feet. Upon my soul, I’m half inclined to send
you back to where you came from and to have nothing
more to do with you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said Dora impulsively. “It
was a hard life at Miss Skimmers’ but&mdash;I wish you
would.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you? Well, I won’t, then! I’m not the
kind of person to invest in stocks and then tear up
the certificates. I may be like a hen who has hatched
out an eagle’s egg, but&mdash;the eagle is of some use to me
at present, and I’m not going to have it kicked out of
the nest, simply because it desires that sort of thing.
I’ve made all my arrangements with Milt Dante, and
I’m going to put you on the stage.”</p>

<p>“No, never!” said Dora, finding her voice suddenly.
“I don’t want to go on the stage; I prefer to be as
I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you? Well, perhaps you haven’t any voice
in the matter. You are under age, and I am your legal
guardian, and it strikes me that you are going to
do as you are bid, whether it meets with your approval<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
or not. I’ve made all arrangements with Mr.
Dante, and you are going to appear here&mdash;in this
very town&mdash;to-morrow night, and are going to be ‘featured’
on the bill as ‘Miss Vance, the niece of Mrs.
Charles Bonair, of Thetford Towers,’ and you are going,
in that character, to lead the March of the Amazons
and to wear as little as the law allows in the
way of dress.”</p>

<p>“I will never do it!” said Dora, starting to her
feet, her whole body shaking and her cheeks aflame,
as she thought of the “ladies” she had seen on the
posters. “I don’t know whether you have told the
truth or not about my being the daughter of a gentleman,
but&mdash;I will never do a thing like that. I will
run away first.”</p>

<p>The figure in the chair rose unsteadily, in a froth
of lace and a billow of roseate silk, and laughingly
drained out the last drop from a champagne bottle on
the table and drank it.</p>

<p>“You won’t get the chance to run away,” she said,
“I shall keep you under my own eye until then. You
will go with me to the theater to-night, and I will put
you under Milt Dante’s care whenever I am obliged
to leave you. As for your appearing on the stage to-morrow
night, you’ll do that if I have to chloroform
you and have you carried on. I’ll pay that woman for<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
trying to shut me out of Crumplesea, make no mistake
about that. Now, come and help me dress; it’s
time I was off to the theater, and that fool of a Bodwin
will be round here with his carriage presently,
to drive me there.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A VIXEN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>What Mr. Milton Dante’s advance agent had predicted
came to pass. Miss Montague-Vance’s triumph
was absolute before the curtain had fallen upon
the first act of “The Beauty of Gotham,” and by the
time the first night’s performance came to an end, all
Crumplesea&mdash;all masculine Crumplesea, that is to say&mdash;was,
metaphorically, at her feet.</p>

<p>Whatever she might be off the stage, there was no
gainsaying the fact that on it, hers was an alluring,
lovely personality, and that her beautiful face, and her
soft dovelike eyes seemed created to make men lose
their heads and their hearts, and to become absolutely
insane over her. She could sing, too&mdash;not merely
carry a tune and let the orchestra furnish all the music,
as so many of her kind do, but sing intelligently,
sweetly, and with a voice that showed cultivation as
well as the melody which had been put into it by nature&mdash;and
as she exerted herself that night as none
of her colleagues had ever known her to do before, it
is scarcely to be wondered that she carried everything
before her, and that the reception accorded to her by<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
delighted Crumplesea partook of the nature of an
ovation.</p>

<p>In all the crowd that filled the new opera house
and cheered and shouted over her success, there was
perhaps only one person&mdash;Dora&mdash;who did not delight
in her triumph.</p>

<p>Seated in a proscenium box under the watchful eye
and the close guardianship of Mr. Milton Dante, the
girl, dumb with shame, and heartsick with despair,
remained all the evening with her eyes cast down, and
never, even once, looked toward the stage. It was
a relief to her when the thing was over, and she was
out in the cool night air again, driving back to Minorca
Villa, with Mr. Milton Dante on one side of her, Mrs.
Skivers&mdash;the wardrobe woman of the company, who
had been told to look after her in future and to share
her room at the villa&mdash;on the other, and her mother
on the box with Mr. Bodwin, chattering and laughing
as they drove home through the fragrant sea-scented
darkness.</p>

<p>It was close to midnight when they came clattering
up to Minorca Villa, to find the landlady&mdash;whose
palm had been rubbed with the magic ointment of
gold beforehand&mdash;awaiting them and a tempting little
supper on the table.</p>

<p>“How sweet of you, dear Mrs. Burners,” said the<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
siren of the evening, as she jumped down and led
the way into the house. “I am positively famished.
Are Miss Dora’s rooms ready? Thank you; she won’t
sit up to-night, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“No, nor any other night,” supplemented Dora herself,
in a low, firm voice. “I have made up my mind
that I will never do what you wish me to do, and you
may as well know that now as later. Let me go away;
let me go back to Miss Skimmers. I tell you I will
never do that thing, never while there is breath in my
body.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going to begin on that strain again?
Take her up to bed, Mrs. Skivers, and come down after
she’s safely tucked in&mdash;and locked in, too, mind&mdash;and
chaperon me! One has to make some concession to
that awful British personage, Mrs. Grundy, you know.”
And then with an airy wave of the hand, she passed
into the room where the supper was spread, leaving
Dora to trudge wearily and dejectedly up the stairs,
in company with Mrs. Skivers.</p>

<p>“A glass of champagne and a cigarette, somebody!
I feel like an eagle that has been shut up for hours
in a cage. Milt, don’t stop to carve that chicken,
when you must know that I’m on fire with impatience
to hear if you have done what I told you?”</p>

<p>“About sending the wire to Mrs. Bonair, you mean?<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
Oh, yes, I attended to that, all right. But not exactly
in the manner we first planned it. Hasn’t Mr.
Bodwin told you?”</p>

<p>“Told me? He’s told me nothing. How could he,
with that stupid girl with us the whole time? What
has been done? What was amiss with the original
scheme?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bodwin didn’t think it would work. He
fancied Mrs. Bonair wouldn’t take any notice of it,
so to make sure, he drove over to the next town, and
as he knows the name of Mrs. Bonair’s lawyer, he
hired a man to go over by trap to Morecome Junction
and wire back this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Have missed connection, and am coming down by
hired conveyance. Look for me. Must see you to-night
on a matter of life and death.</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“‘<span class="smcap">Hazlitt.</span>’</p>
</div>

<p>“That will keep her up no matter how late the hour
is, and she will see you when you go.”</p>

<p>“As she wouldn’t, I am convinced, dear Miss Montague,
if you acted on your original plan,” put in Mr.
Bodwin. “I don’t mind telling you that I owe her a
grudge for trying to ruin the opening of the opera
house; and besides, I&mdash;I would do anything in the
world for you.”</p>

<p>“What a dear you are,” she said, with a laugh, and<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
one of her arch glances. “You shall take me for a
ride to-morrow for that, and I will take care that our
dear, sweet friend never finds out that you had anything
to do with this business. Now another glass
to the success of the venture, Milt, and then away we
go! Show her claws to me, will she, the cat? Look
here! there will be some fur flying to-night, unless I’m
out in my reckoning.”</p>

<p>The second glass of champagne was poured out and
drained, but&mdash;the start was not yet; for just then
Mrs. Skivers reappeared upon the scene with word
that she had seen Dora up to her room and locked her
in, and there had to be a third glass in consequence.</p>

<p>“Stop here, Mrs. Skivers, and wait for us,” said
Rosalind, when she finally rose and let Mr. Bodwin
again wrap her in the long cloak she had discarded
on entering. “I’m going for a short drive with the
gentlemen. You’ll find plenty to eat and drink, but
mind you, don’t take too much for your own good.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look out for that,” said Dante, as he slid an
unopened bottle into each pocket of his coat and took
possession of three clean glasses.</p>

<p>“‘Lead on; I follow thee.’”</p>

<p>Outside, Mr. Bodwin’s private carriage still stood
waiting. They trooped out and got into it and went
skimming off through the darkness again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[305]</span></p>

<p>Crumplesea was like a cemetery now, so still and
black and lifeless it was. They scudded through it
and whirled out upon the cliffs, with the sea droning
and curling long zigzag lines of froth far down below
them, and the moonless sky stretching velvet-dark
above.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes or so they drove along with
the wind in their faces, the blown salt scent of the
sea in their nostrils; then the carriage swung suddenly
round a curve that took it inland, bowled along a quiet
road hedged with brambles and overhung with trees,
and, whirling at length out of this, came full upon
an immense double row of oaks leading up to a building
set in the midst of a sort of park.</p>

<p>What it was like, this building, the darkness made
it impossible to ascertain with any degree of certainty,
but in the lower windows of it lights were burning
and gave vague glimpses of a long, broad veranda curtained
with flowering vines and of a stone-railed terrace
dotted at regular intervals with urns that were
full of flowers.</p>

<p>“Here we are; this is Thetford Towers,” said Mr.
Bodwin, in a whisper. But before he could say more,
a flash of nearer light revealed the presence of a lodge&mdash;half
lost in a wilderness of vines&mdash;and of a man
looming out to open the gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[306]</span></p>

<p>“It’s you at last, sir,” the man said, as he made
everything ready for the vehicle to enter the grounds.
“Mrs. Bonair has been watching for you this long
time, sir. I think you’ll find her in the veranda, sir.
It’s an uncommon hot night, and she is a rare one for
fresh air, as no doubt you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, she will get something more than ‘fresh
air’ in this case,” said Rosalind, with a soft, low
laugh, as the carriage swept by and bowled up the
broad driveway to the house. “Fancy the old cat living
in such luxury as this and never giving a farthing
piece to me. You wait! I’ll make her pay dear
for it! She shall pour out sacks of money to me before
to-morrow night, or I’ll disgrace her so that
she’ll never show her face in public again. Look, will
you? Look! There’s somebody walking up and down
that terrace, and it’s a woman, I can see her passing
by those lighted windows.”</p>

<p>“’S-h-h-! it’s Mrs. Bonair herself,” whispered Mr.
Bodwin. “I’ve seen her too many years to be mistaken
in her. My dear, if you wouldn’t mind my stopping
here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course, I don’t. Didn’t I say you shouldn’t be
known in the affair? Stop at once and let me go on
alone. Milt, if there’s another glassful left in that
bottle I’ll take it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[307]</span></p>

<p>“Better not, Rose; you’ve had enough, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“Never mind what you are ‘thinking,’ I’m the best
judge of what I want. A fresh glassful and a fresh
cigarette, please; I’m going to interview my sister-in-law.
Thank you so much! Here’s health and prosperity
to all of us. And now&mdash;for trouble.”</p>

<p>Speaking, she scrambled down from the vehicle&mdash;a
little unsteadily, as both Mr. Bodwin and Mr. Dante
observed&mdash;and, cigarette in mouth, ran jauntily up to
the veranda.</p>

<p>“Good evening, my dear,” she said, as she skipped
airily into the veranda and confronted Mrs. Bonair.
“You needn’t wait any longer for Mr. Hazlitt, because
he hasn’t the slightest knowledge of the wire that was
sent you, and I dare say that he has been in bed and
asleep for hours. Need I introduce myself?”</p>

<p>Berry turned quickly, and faced her visitor. There
was a brief pause; then she answered with cold, calm,
scornful dignity:</p>

<p>“No, that is not in the least necessary. But you
may tell me, if you wish, why you presume to come
here.”</p>

<p>“I have come to either open your precious moneybags
or to make you pay dearly for trying to shut
me out of Crumplesea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[308]</span></p>

<p>Berry gave a sort of faint gasp&mdash;so low that it was
scarcely audible&mdash;then pulled herself together and
tapped on the pane of the nearest window.</p>

<p>“Thompson,” she said imperatively; “Thompson,
come out here at once and take this creature away.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A LAST DECISION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Rosalind’s insolent face went red with wrath.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who ‘Thompson’ is or whether it’s a
man or a woman,” she said threateningly, “but it will
be a bad night’s business for both of you, if either he or
she tries anything of that sort. I’ve some friends
within call, and if I can’t take care of myself without
them, I’ve only to call, to get all the help I need.”</p>

<p>Berry looked the unutterable disgust she felt, and
she involuntarily drew back a step from her unwelcome
visitor. Fortunately for all concerned, however,
Thompson&mdash;who was one of the under footmen&mdash;was
in another part of the house at the time and did
not, therefore, put in an appearance in response to her
ladyship’s request.</p>

<p>Rosalind waited for a moment in expectation of
hostilities of a more formidable character than the mere
resentment of an indignant gentlewoman, and, finding
that none were likely to come, stuck her cigarette between
her lips again and blew out a long writhing
plume of smoke.</p>

<p>“I reckon that ‘Thompson’ knows when he’s well<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
off, and has made himself scarce,” she said with a
laugh and a wave of one very much bejeweled hand.
“And as there’s no way for you to get into the house
unless I choose to step aside and let you, I also reckon
you’ve got to stand and face the music whether you
like it or not. Turn about’s fair play the world over.
You tried to shut me out of Crumplesea, and now I’m
shutting you in&mdash;in your own veranda.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of me, that you have had the
impudence to come here and to play me such a trick
as you have done?” asked Berry, with cool scorn. “No!
don’t come any nearer; keep your distance, please; you
are quite too close for comfort as it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you want to know what I’ve come for, do you?
Well, you shall&mdash;and in short order, too! Yes, and
you’ll dance to a more expensive tune than I first
intended for treating me like this. Ten thousand
would have bought me off when first I came, but it’ll
cost you fifty thousand now, I promise you.”</p>

<p>“There’s a mistake on your part&mdash;it won’t cost me a
penny. If you have any idea of blackmailing me because
you are&mdash;well, what you are, get that idea out
of your mind at once. That my stepbrother married
a creature who was&mdash;and apparently still is&mdash;scarcely
a fit associate for one of my scullery maids and that I
disowned him for it, are matters that are known to<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
every one who knows me, and I should scarcely be
likely to pay you money to keep secret a thing that is
public property.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s the ‘tack’ you’re going on, is it? Well,
suppose I start in telling something that everybody
doesn’t know&mdash;not even you yourself&mdash;what then?
Look here, my Lady High and Mighty, you snuffed
me out as a wife and widow, but you can’t snuff me out
as a mother&mdash;the mother of your brother’s daughter,
a child born in honorable wedlock nearly eighteen years
ago.”</p>

<p>Save that it grew perhaps the fraction of a shade
paler, Berry’s face changed not one whit.</p>

<p>She flung away her cigarette and fumbled for a moment
among the folds of her skirt, then her unsteady
hand drew a packet of paper from her pocket, loosened
the bit of string that held it together, and flirted off
two documents from the top.</p>

<p>“There’s her baptismal certificate, for one, and my
marriage lines, for another,” she said, “and here’s one
of Adrian’s letters to me acknowledging that he knew
there was going to be a child. Solid evidence that,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; indisputable evidence. But again&mdash;quite
unnecessary! Why all this palaver? I really don’t
see what you are driving at. Neither I, nor my husband,<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
nor any one else, ever doubted your announcement,
years ago. We simply had no interest in the
matter. What is your intention?”</p>

<p>“Now look here: here’s what is going to happen
to-morrow night, if you don’t buy me off at my own
price, and take that girl off my hands.”</p>

<p>Speaking, she unfolded the last of the papers she
held, filling the air as she did so with the faint, sickly
smell of fresh printer’s ink, and shook out a still damp
half-sheet poster.</p>

<p>Berry did not notice it for a moment; she had taken
up the baptismal certificate and the faded letter. But
she turned at last and saw the bill that was held up
for her inspection. And for the first time her face
became really pale.</p>

<p>“Looks nice, doesn’t it?” said Rosalind, with a little
babble of splenetic mockery. “Your niece is going to
lead the Amazon march, and&mdash;in tights! She says she
won’t, but she will, you know; she’ll have to give in&mdash;people
always have to do that where I’m concerned.
You’ll do it presently, like all the rest, and I shall
leave this place with your check for fifty thousand
pounds in my pocket or else these bills go up to-morrow
morning, and what’s printed on them will happen
to-morrow night. It doesn’t do to run foul of me,
does it, now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[313]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Berry, in a low, level voice;
“and I really don’t think that I care, either. If you
have set your mind upon doing this thing, you must
do it, of course. And now, if you have said all that
you have to say, be good enough to relieve me of your
presence. You cannot extort one copper out of me,
madam, no matter what you propose to do.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A VAIN THREAT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“What!” she said, in a loud, aggressive voice, “you’ll
let this thing go on? You’ll let your brother’s daughter
be put on the stage and made a spectacle of, and you
won’t pay me my price to prevent it?”</p>

<p>“I will not pay you one penny&mdash;no, not even one
farthing&mdash;to prevent that or any other piece of blackguardism
you may contemplate committing. The girl
is nothing to me, less than nothing since she is your
daughter. Do what you please with her; it is a matter
of perfect indifference to me, but I warn you that if
you take liberties with my name in the manner you
propose to do, it will be actionable, and I shall instruct
my lawyer to prosecute.”</p>

<p>For one moment Rosalind stood irresolute, rage
tearing at her like a ravenous wolf and the fumes of the
wine she had drank mounting higher and higher until
her head swam. Then, of a sudden, she lurched away
from the rail of the veranda and leaped forward like
a cat springing at a mouse, her two hands reaching out
and shutting upon Berry’s throat.</p>

<p>“You’re a pig, you’re a stingy, spiteful, vicious old
pig!” she said, as she shook her with all her strength.<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
“I’ll make you suffer for this! I will, as I’m a living
woman! Those bills go up in the morning&mdash;do you
hear me? and you can send some one to Crumplesea
Opera House to-morrow night, if you think I’m afraid
of your threats of prosecution and won’t disgrace your
name as I said I would. Defy me, will you? You’ll
see what it costs, you’ll see, you’ll see!”</p>

<p>And here, with one final shake, she pushed from her,
and scudded out of the veranda and ran dizzily down
the path to the waiting vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. Bodwin and Mr. Milton Dante, who were anxiously
awaiting her return, saw her the very instant she
appeared.</p>

<p>“I say! it is really you at last,” said Mr. Dante, as
she came reeling up to the vehicle. “We began to think
you were never coming, and&mdash;&mdash;Hello! what’s up?
You look as though you were in a dickens of a temper.
Has the old girl been using you roughly, and wouldn’t
she pay the price, after all?”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t pay any price, even a farthing’s
worth!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that she intends to let it
go on?”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I intend to say, I’ll tell you in
time enough. Turn the horse round a bit, the wheel
is in the way of the step and I want to get in. What’s<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
the matter with you two? Don’t you know how to
manage a horse? You keep the thing prancing about
so much I can’t get on the step.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it’s not me, Miss Vance,” declared Mr. Bodwin;
“it’s you; you’re frightening it by rattling that
bell and slipping off the step so often, and it simply
won’t stand still!”</p>

<p>“Oh! it won’t, eh? Thinks it can play tricks on me
like every one else this evening, does it? I’ll show it&mdash;the
beast!”</p>

<p>Her temper was up now in real earnest.</p>

<p>She lurched away from the side of the vehicle after
still another futile effort to keep her foothold upon the
step, and by the time the two men divined her intention
she was halfway to the horse’s head.</p>

<p>“Stop!” screeched out Mr. Milton Dante.</p>

<p>“Miss Vance, for Heaven’s sake!” began Mr. Bodwin;
but both cries fell upon deaf ears.</p>

<p>Blind with rage and maddened with drink, she rushed
at the horse’s head, caught at the bridle with one hand,
and with the other struck it full in the face.</p>

<p>“Defy me, will you, you beast?” she began, and
then&mdash;spoke never again!</p>

<p>The reins that Mr. Bodwin was holding slackened
suddenly and curved in a loop between his knees for
one instant before they drew taut again; the horse<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
reared in terror, an awful figure in the dark of the
night, over the small slight shape which for two seconds
stood erect in the pathway, then came a
thud of descending hoofs and a little bleat of
agony, and in the winking of an eye men and vehicle
were being whirled off through the darkness by a
runaway horse, and all that was mortal of the woman
whose loveliness had charmed all Crumplesea to-night
lay huddled up in the dust with one arm twisted under
it and its skull crushed in like an eggshell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following day, Berry&mdash;who had lain awake
all night, wondering what she ought to do, and finally
resolving to find her niece and save her from the disgrace
that threatened her&mdash;lost no time in tracing the
unhappy girl.</p>

<p>To her surprise, she was charmed with her niece,
after only an hour’s talk with Dora. Childless herself,
and loving children dearly, Berry welcomed Dora
to her heart and home; and when Charles returned
from America, he, too, rejoiced in Berry’s happiness.</p>

<p>Thus Dora found in Berry a mother who deserved
and won her love, and in Charles a kind father, to
take the place of one whom she had never known.</p>

<p class="center xxlargefont boldfont">Love Stories</p>

<p>There is a great deal of difference between
love stories and sex stories. There is something
about <em>love</em> which commands respect and
reverence.</p>

<p>There is nothing about the sex story which
commands either. Most decent-minded people
are disgusted with the sort of literature
that some publishers are putting out in the
guise of truth.</p>

<p>If you want to know what a really decent,
clean, wholesome love story is, ask your dealer
to sell you a copy of the <cite>Bertha Clay Library</cite>,
or the <cite>Eagle Library</cite>.</p>

<p>In these two series, you will find everything
that is necessary in fiction to hold your
interest, and a great deal that is preferable to
the sort of stuff which is being put out under
camouflage by certain publishers who are not
very careful either about the way they make
money or what they publish.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
